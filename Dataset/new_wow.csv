46,Weather Effects in Warcraft,"A year ago, there was a post created about weather effects being back in warcraft:[https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/91j79f/weather\_effects\_are\_back\_weather\_commands/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/91j79f/weather_effects_are_back_weather_commands/)

I've been working on an addon since the day Nathanos professed his love to Sylvanas that sets weather intensity to the max but also sets fog to the max for added mystery. The addon does a few more things as well and you are all welcome to check it out, should you be so inclined.[https://github.com/jadissa/wow/tree/master/jlelz-ui](https://github.com/jadissa/wow/tree/master/jlelz-ui)

62,Allied Race speculation,"So because it's fun to speculate on these things without taking it too seriously, I have been thinking about the Allied Races that we have so far, those that we know are on the way and the potential for those moving forward.

Each Allied Race that exists has a comparative Playable Race that it is based off of, whether that mean it is based off of it's rigging/animation or its model with minor tweaks:

**Legion**
    
    * Highmountain Tauren   > Tauren
    * Nightborne   > Night Elf
    * Lightforged Draenei   > Draenei
    * Void Elf   > Blood Elf

**Battle For Azeroth**

    * Mag'har Orc   > Orc
    * Dark Iron Dwarf   > Dwarf

This is where I come in and say that so far the only truly unique rigs for Allied Races are Zandalari Trolls and Kul'Tiran Humans, though even they have Race-based comparatives in-game:

    * Zandalari Troll   > Troll
    * Kul'Tiran Human   > Human

Now the upcoming Allied Races that we're aware of are based off of existing rigs, but are more heavily modified when you compare them to something like LightForged Draenei or Mag'har Orcs:

    * Vulpera   > Goblin
    * Mechagnome   > Gnome

So what does that leave us with in terms of remaining options that aren't utilizing existing rigs/races? Undead, Worgen and Pandaren. I've been trying to think of available options:

    * Undead   > Lightforged Undead (given the Calia situation)
    * Worgen   > Saberon from WoD (though it seems incredibly out of place)
    * Pandaren > Tortollan (unsure if the rigging is the same), Tuskarr

If we are really moving toward a Wrath 2.0 type of expansion, I think it's possible to entertain that races like Tuskarr, Taunka, Earthen/Iron Dwarf/Frost Dwarf or even Vrykul could potentially be playable races. 

What do you think the next Allied Races will be?",1571220075.0,"Allied Race speculationSo because it's fun to speculate on these things without taking it too seriously, I have been thinking about the Allied Races that we have so far, those that we know are on the way and the potential for those moving forward.

88,"My ideal expansion, systems wise, would:"," 

1. **Bring back artifact weapons**, BUT without the skills, using the concept of the essences in heart of azeroth (which would unlock account wide). Reasons being: a) its an extra layer of choice and customization b) weapons have always been so friggin hard to come by that all my characters are always several ilvls behind their gear with their weapon. Plus artifact weapons added to the story, felt awesome to have and added more lore/ quests
2. **Give back all skills all classes have lost since WOTLK**. Yes, all skills. I dont care if some of them are sub-optimal, I would be the 1% that would choose to use one of them for flavor and fun even if that caused me a 5% dps loss.
3. **No new classes**, but focus on going back to WOTLK old style talent trees and redo every spec progress from there. Evolve into something with more talent tiers, more choices per tier and more customization
4. **Give DH their well deserved 3rd spec**. Possibly with a scythe (and finally make scythes a weapon type), more focused on mixing aoe sweep attacks and long range spells.
5. **Remove race/class restrictions**. Nothing to say on this one, just that after 15 years, if someone wants to play a gnome paladin, they’ve damn well earned it after sticking to the game this long. Create a toy called “Lore Buff” that someone can use if they feel offended by someone else’s race/class choice so that to that person, they see only race appropriate classes. (i/e to their eyes you’re a human paladin)
6. **Undo all the harm BFA has done**. Which means the change in armor only protecting against physical damage (and consequently allowing a lot of spells that were changed to physical damage to going back to their real damage type. Also remove the GCD changes, those are still awful to this day.
7. **Give each class something truly unique**. I am all for bring the player not the class, but homogenization sucks. So what if a fire mage has a 10% resist to fire damage, if I want to bring a warlock to the same encounter I can just buy a scroll that does the same thing. But the mage has that passive, its part of him, its part of what makes him special.

100,Speculation: Next Expansion with be Return to Northrend,"This will contain massive spoilers. Read at your own discretion.


I have been musing over the 8.3 datamined info for a few days. 

So far we have a few hints as to the next expansion being a return to northrend, so many that at this point I’d pretty much place gold on it.

In game hints:
-Voljin quest that takes us to ICC where we see the lich king is up to something.
-We learn in that same quest line with Voljin that ICC is a gateway directly to the shadowlands.  
-Talia introduced in BFA for alliance and built into a likable new character.
- Extreme death focus through out BFA
-BlizzCon goodies for Warcraft: a transmog item based upon the yeti and it’s description hunting to “stay warm during our travels.”

Data mined info that tips this off:
-Talia wants to know about her fathers fate in northrend, discussion between jaina and anduin. 
- the elves are going to Nordrassil as their new home, discussion between Tyrande and her sentinels.
-data mined skins for new allied race death knights.
-encrypted data mined dialogue between Bolvar and Darion.

At this point, there’s absolutely no way we will not be in northrend next expansion, which also will have a huge focus on the shadowlands. Expecting first tier to be the a fully fleshed out nerubian empire zone and raid, 2nd tier ICC version 2 with sylvanas as the boss, 3rd tier being the shadowlands in the same concept as Argus and Nyalotha have been. Expecting to see allied races horde: tuskar and the sanlyn, alliance gets: vykrul, Frost dwarves/wildhammer. 

What do you guys think?",1571203594.0,"Speculation: Next Expansion with be Return to NorthrendThis will contain massive spoilers. Read at your own discretion.

Why are we making this?"" Is it hindsight bias? I think there was enough evidence to have predicted that these races would not be well received.

&#x200B;

* Kul Tirans are, in some aspects, the most unique of the Allied Races from a development point of view. They were built almost from the ground up with nearly as much work put into them as core races. They currently sit at 0.7% of the characters at 120 and I'll be pleasantly surprised when they finally break 1%, if they ever do. It makes me sad to think what they could have given us with all that wasted time and resources. What made the devs think that anyone wanted to play obese humans?
* Before Kul Tirans gnomes were the second least popular race in the game and arguably one of the most vocally hated. The devs answer to this was to create amputee diaper gnomes that can't fully make use of the transmog feature and arguably only look decent in their heritage armor, which we probably won't even be able to use unless you level them

In contrast no one should be surprised that Vulpera and Dark Iron Dwarves have generally been well received by the community. Multi-page Vulpera request threads have been a mainstay of WoW forums since they were first introduced at the beginning of BFA and Dark Iron Dwarves were one of the most requested races by Alliance players besides High Elves, Sethrak etc. From the very beginning when the Mechagnome and Kul Tiran models were datamined the response from Alliance players was overwhelmingly negative and there definitely were no request threads anywhere for these guys.",1571200324.0,"How did Kul Tirans and Mechagnomes make it through development?I'm genuinely baffled how at no point throughout the process of creating these races it didn't occur to anyone to say: ""no one is going to play this.

126,Creating new specs for fun and glory,"We've all thought on it at one time or another: what new specs could be added to WoW? It's a fun idea to run away with, so I thought I'd share my ideas and ask for all of yours, too. I won't be going into detail of how they'd play, but rather just explain the theme and role. If you'd like to go deeper, please do! 

My list incorporates two ideas to add the fun:

1. **New specs should allow classes a new role.**

2. **There are four roles: Tank, healing, *melee* DPS and *ranged* DPS.** 

This does, however, not address the question if pure DPS classes should remain pure DPS. I'm sure there are plenty of feelings on this subject going one way or the other, but for the fun of this exercise I will not restrict currently pure classes to remaining pure, though you're very welcome to do so on your own.

I'll start of with the ones I think are easiest to accept and work my way down to the more... dubious possibilities. Enjoy!

> Monk

**Chi Dancer - Ranged DPS.** This is the one I'm sure people would love the most, with the major challenge of avoiding a lawsuit by Toei Animation. We already have a chi wave, and this spec would build on that for ranged chi attacks, which I'm sure would do a mix of arcane and nature damage. A chi disk there, a turtle wave there and this spec could shine.

> Shaman

**Earth Warden - Tank.** This one has been said over and over, but it really does work. A shaman of the earth that uses it to shield himself. I don't have much more to add that others haven't gone into great detail with since this spec isn't a hard sell. Maybe let them be the spec that gets to use totems, and let them use a big none-race specific totem, too.

> Death Knight

**Flesh Knight - Ranged DPS.** I figured ""flesh"" would be a better word for it rather than describing them as ""Necromancer Knights."" It's as simple as that: Give them spectres, skeletons, bone shots, and the all important corpse explosion! I imagine plague knights would be weary of sharing their dead armies, but I think there's plenty of dead to go around. 

> Paladin

**Devotion - Ranged DPS.** At first, Paladin felt like it'd be difficult. The first instinct is to go for some sort of Shadow paladin in line with Priests, but overall that just doesn't quite feel right for me. A priest, while often holy, can be a priest of anything as long as it doesn't cross over to shamanstic or druidic stuff. A paladin really does feel like a vessel of the light, and looking at it we really don't have any ranged light purely DPS specs (sorry Disc Priest). It's not the most exciting thing in the world, but there's room to work with. Give them the sound effect and copy the animation of Avenging Wrath from hearthstone and go from there.

> Warrior

**Arsenal - Ranged DPS.** Let's go back to something older, something forgotten: Thrown weapons. Then let's go overboard on that idea. This one was slightly inspired by the MoP dungeon boss Xin the Weaponmaster. The idea is simple: You have weapons. Lots and lots of weapons. Your auto attack throws spears (possible your main polearm weapon if it wouldn't look funky), you toss out blades that spin on their own, and you dig deep into your stores more powerful weapons. Thunder Spear! Fiery Waraxe! As long as there's armor with tons of weapons glued to it, and a back armor that's just a bunch of spears, then I think this spec could work. As a silly side note, I think there could be a fun talent where you summon a powerful weapon for a single attack, and maybe it just happens to be one of many old artifact weapons. Maybe that's a bit too magical for warrior, but it'd be a fun gimmick. 

> Priest

**Blood - Melee DPS.** Forgive me. There's recently been plenty of blood priest enemies, so it'd make sense to practice such vile worship as a character. Differentiating it from Blood Death Knights would be important, but it's possible when you focus on one ability priests already have that is the origination of this whole idea: Vampiric Touch. I know, I know. Introducing a class that is basically vampires into WoW would be chaotic, but you just know plenty of people would love it, and it hearkens back to the dreadlord abilities from Warcraft 3. Give them a cone of bats to shoot point blank. Give them sleep. Have them wield daggers and suck blood. Shadow Priests would probably lose the word Vampiric from their abilities, but it's a small price. 

>Mage

**Time - Healing.** This one arises over Spellswords for two reasons: there aren't any other new healing specs on this list and damn if there isn't a bunch of fun ideas with manipulating time. Give certain party members haste, make them run faster, slow down the boss for a short time, and reverse time to reverse damage. Imagine if, as a major cooldown, they could refresh another party member's major cooldown. Scary, fun stuff.

> Warlock

**Void Binder - Tank.** This is where we start to get iffy and where Shadow priests get even more upset with me. This whole spec is based off the Void Walker pet, something that hasn't really been all that explored. There is, however, a major difference between this spec and Shadow priests - control. Shadow priests have a theme of temporary letting the void take their sanity, whereas a Void Binder would thematically control the void as they do demons, chain the void and domineer it under their will to protect their allies. Of course there'd have to be some sort of look to Void Binders to not make them look like squishy clothies all the time, but that's why they're this low on the list. Sure, soul healing could also be a spec, but Warlocks' relationship to the void has always been interesting to me personally.

> Hunter

**Rider - Tank.** Something so simple, something players have wanted for years, yet so hard to implement. Let hunters ride their pets! And those sturdy mounts in turn can take a lot of damage. A mounted combatant would be great thematically, but the pool of ride-able pets would probably be small, and the pets themselves would have to have size restrictions due to the thing that kills this spec the most: doorways. Tauren hunters on their kodos would be a sad sight in a tight dungeon. Perhaps there could be an ability that allows you to dismount for a short time without losing your defenses, but that almost defeats the purpose. Still, a fun idea.

> Druid

**Flame - Hybrid DPS.** Okay, so there was another way to look at DPS thanks to survival hunters who move in close for most of their time and then have temporary ranged capabilities. However, this spec would instead stick to ranged flame throwing while only sometimes leaping into a flaming cat form to apply harsh fire damage, maybe even as their major 2 or 3 minute cooldown. It'd be a fun mix, and really the last thing druids could do that they can't already besides a Disc Priest type healing. Plus druids have wanted a little of that flame magic since Druids of the Flame have been a thing.

> Rogue

**Spectral - Ranged DPS.** I'll be the first to admit that this is where my ideas start to wear thin. The base idea is that this rogue has spectral weapons to attack at a range, and uses all other assortment of ghostly attacks to deal damage. It's a bit off-putting to use death magic, but not all too far off from the rogueish archetype. 

> Demon Hunter

**Mayhem - Ranged DPS.** I can see now why they didn't already give Demon Hunters a third spec... It'd be difficult not to pull more from Warlocks (in this case, Destro) in order to use more fel magic. My best idea is they throw around glaives, shoot ranged eye lasers, summon fel beings, and can fight from above for a short time similar to the existing PVP talent. Raining Fel Fire from above could be nice until ceilings and doorways come into play. Side note: The dumbest idea I had for this was to let them fly up and go into FPS mode. I'm sure you'll all have something better for these guys.

share my idea and ask for all of your too won be go into detail of how they play but rather just explain the theme and role If you like to go deeper pleas do My list incorpor two idea to add the fun new spec should allow class new role there are four role tank heal mele dp and rang dp thi doe howev not address the question if pure dp class should remain pure dp sure there are plenti of feel on thi subject go one way or the other but for the fun of thi exercis will not restrict current pure class to remain pure though you re veri welcom to do so on your own ll start of with the one think are easiest to accept and work my way down to the more dubiou possibl enjoy monk chi dancer rang dp thi is the one sure peopl would love the most with the major challeng of avoid lawsuit by toei anim We alreadi have chi wave and thi spec would build on that for rang chi attack which sure would do mix of arcan and natur damag chi disk there turtl wave there and thi spec could shine shaman earth warden tank thi one ha been said over and over but it realli doe work shaman of the earth that use it to shield himself don have much more to add that other haven gone into great detail with sinc thi spec isn hard sell mayb let them be the spec that get to use totem and let them use big none race specif totem too death knight flesh knight rang dp figur flesh would be better word for it rather than describ them as necromanc knight It as simpl as that give them spectr skeleton bone shot and the all import corps explos imagin plagu knight would be weari of share their dead armi but think there plenti of dead to go around paladin devot rang dp At first paladin felt like it be difficult the first instinct is to go for some sort of shadow paladin in line with priest but overal that just doesn quit feel right for me priest while often holi can be priest of anyth as long as it doesn cross over to shamanst or druidic stuff paladin realli doe feel like vessel of the light and look at it we realli don have ani rang light pure dp spec sorri disc priest It not the most excit thing in the world but there room to work with give them the sound effect and copi the anim of aveng wrath from hearthston and go from there warrior arsen rang dp let go back to someth older someth forgotten thrown weapon then let go overboard on that idea thi one wa slightli inspir by the mop dungeon boss xin the weaponmast the idea is simpl you have weapon lot and lot of weapon your auto attack throw spear possibl your main polearm weapon if it wouldn look funki you toss out blade that spin on their own and you dig deep into your store more power weapon thunder spear fieri warax As long as there armor with ton of weapon glu to it and back armor that just bunch of spear then think thi spec could work As silli side note think there could be fun talent where you summon power weapon for singl attack and mayb it just happen to be one of mani old artifact weapon mayb that bit too magic for warrior but it be fun gimmick priest blood mele dp forgiv me there recent been plenti of blood priest enemi so it make sens to practic such vile worship as charact differenti it from blood death knight would be import but it possibl when you focu on one abil priest alreadi have that is the origin of thi whole idea vampir touch know know introduc class that is basic vampir into wow would be chaotic but you just know plenti of peopl would love it and it hearken back to the dreadlord abil from warcraft give them cone of bat to shoot point blank give them sleep have them wield dagger and suck blood shadow priest would probabl lose the word vampir from their abil but it small price mage time heal thi one aris over spellsword for two reason there aren ani other new heal spec on thi list and damn if there isn bunch of fun idea with manipul time give certain parti member hast make them run faster slow down the boss for short time and revers time to revers damag imagin if as major cooldown they could refresh anoth parti member major cooldown scari fun stuff warlock void binder tank thi is where we start to get iffi and where shadow priest get even more upset with me thi whole spec is base off the void walker pet someth that hasn realli been all that explor there is howev major differ between thi spec and shadow priest control shadow priest have theme of temporari let the void take their saniti wherea void binder would themat control the void as they do demon chain the void and domin it under their will to protect their alli Of cours there have to be some sort of look to void binder to not make them look like squishi clothi all the time but that whi they re thi low on the list sure soul heal could also be spec but warlock relationship to the void ha alway been interest to me person hunter rider tank someth so simpl someth player have want for year yet so hard to implement let hunter ride their pet and those sturdi mount in turn can take lot of damag mount combat would be great themat but the pool of ride abl pet would probabl be small and the pet themselv would have to have size restrict due to the thing that kill thi spec the most doorway tauren hunter on their kodo would be sad sight in tight dungeon perhap there could be an abil that allow you to dismount for short time without lose your defens but that almost defeat the purpos still fun idea druid flame hybrid dp okay so there wa anoth way to look at dp thank to surviv hunter who move in close for most of their time and then have temporari rang capabl howev thi spec would instead stick to rang flame throw while onli sometim leap into flame cat form to appli harsh fire damag mayb even as their major or minut cooldown It be fun mix and realli the last thing druid could do that they can alreadi besid disc priest type heal plu druid have want littl of that flame magic sinc druid of the flame have been thing rogu spectral rang dp ll be the first to admit that thi is where my idea start to wear thin the base idea is that thi rogu ha spectral weapon to attack at rang and use all other assort of ghostli attack to deal damag It bit off put to use death magic but not all too far off from the rogueish archetyp demon hunter mayhem rang dp can see now whi they didn alreadi give demon hunter third spec It be difficult not to pull more from warlock in thi case destro in order to use more fel magic My best idea is they throw around glaiv shoot rang eye laser summon fel be and can fight from abov for short time similar to the exist pvp talent rain fel fire from abov could be nice until ceil and
