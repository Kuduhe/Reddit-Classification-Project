6,Recomendation: Bring back old school chests for next expac.,"So i've been playing on and off of classic wow. Only level 30 or so. Retail is still my main game. But while exploring the world there are things i see. I hate chests in current wow. They are a big silver block on your mini map so you don't even have to look for them. But in classic. You go into the questing area, and you are rewarded for exploring. Just the other day i got my quests done but i stopped and said to my self. ""I am gonna check up stairs."" Sure enough i find a chest and held Kilmaim a level 21 axe.

9,Major Reasons why Class Order halls need to be a permanent/ongoing aspect of Wow,"As a player of wow for 10 years, order halls were something that has stuck out as awesome to play through. So I felt compelled to write out some objective reasons why they need to stay in the game.

&#x200B;

* **It's the easiest cash grab blizzard**. Alt-aholics like myself would love to create new characters and spend hours exploring the halls physically and through quests.
* You can't just reveal the HQ of the paladins, the HQ of the Warlocks, the HQ of the rogues, etc... and just expect us to forget about those places. It's such a tease.
* **The storytelling and unity.** Seeing all the order halls doing what they can individually to find ways to stop the legion (or whatever X threat is showcased for the given expansion) was amazing. I liked watching the DKs rebuild the 4 horsemen, or Thorim rescue Hodir, or the warlocks dive into the twisting nether to rescue colleagues who got too obsessed with the wrong kind of dark magic. The epic finale of all the class halls coming together as a single unit was something badass in wow I havent really seen since Wotlk (imo). Since BFAs launch how many class quests were there?
* **I actually started to appreciate the class I picked**. Because I was surrounded by other warlocks, I was compelled to better understand what makes my warlock cool and tick.

I am not a 100% sure yet, since I did not have the time to prove it yet, but I think that after you change factions - I changed from horde to alliance - you keep the rep u already farmed transferred or translated to the matching factions of in my case alliance. But you also get to do the whole quest line in the areas for the new faction meaning you get extra rep because you have all the ‚Äúnew‚Äù areas to quest again. 

Can someone confirm this?

73,"Thoughts about Kitty Druid going forward, my ideas.","Heya all! So this will be the first time I ever post on Reddit so if this is written in the incorrect section/category I apologize. Just a friendly warning but this will be a long and deep post. 

I've had a lot of thoughts about Feral for the past few years of how I'd like to see the spec be adjusted in the future. This will be based on my opinions but if yours differ feel free to weigh in as well as more perspectives is always cool. Just remember to keep it all respectful as I only want to share and have a discussion about it if people would be interested. But without further delay, let's begin.

I'll start off by listing the spells and passives I'd like to see removed as a whole, but please read the full post for context before drawing a conclusion.

# Removed:

* Predatory Swiftness (Passive)
* Omen of Clarity (Passive)
* Thrash
* Regrowth
* Rip
* Entangling Roots
* Cyclone (PvP talent)
* Ferocious Wound (PvP talent)
* Mighty Bash/Typhoon/Mass Root (lvl 60 row)

**Note**: The removal of all of those abilities also assumes a ***complete*** overhaul of the current talents and removal of all existing Azerite effects and Essences. As a sidenote I do not believe PvP talents are necessary at all if the core foundation of the spec is powerful in it's own right, but I also do not condemn them. However, the above mentioned two should be removed regardless in my opinion. Also, I specifically mention the current CC row as I believe my iteration would overload Feral's availability to CC's if they remained.

Alright, so let's dive into the good stuff.

&#x200B;

# Changes:

*Replace Energy with Ferocity. Ferocity generates similar to Fury while being complimented by the Combo Point system Feral has always had. Ferocity set to 175. Combo Points remains capped at 5. Ferocity will decay when out of combat.*

*Rake adjusted*: Generates 30 Ferocity. Other functionality unchanged. 

*Shred adjusted*: Generates 20 Ferocity. 5s CD, has 2 charges. Deals 40% increased damage to bleeding targets.

*Swipe adjusted*: Generates 12 Ferocity per target hit, up to 36. When striking only one target Swipe deals 25% increased damage. When striking two targets or more Swipe causes targets to bleed for X amount over 12 seconds.

*Moonfire baseline*: deals Arcane damage and applies a DoT, generates 1 CP and applies Elune's Gaze. Lasts 16s. 30 Yard range.

*Ravage reintroduced*: Deals high instant damage (about 3 times that of a non-empowered Shred), generates 50 Ferocity and 1 CP. Only useable when prowling. 

&#x200B;

*Primal Wrath baseline*, applies Rip. Costs 1-5 CP. Can consume up to 75 Ferocity to increase damage. 

*Ferocious Bite adjusted*: Costs 1-5 CP. Can consume up to 50 Ferocity to refresh Rip on the target. If 100 Ferocity is used Ferocious Bite will deal an additional 50% increased damage.

**NEW**: ***Arcane Slash*** (spender): The Druids claws becomes imbued with Arcane energy, slashing up to 5 times over 3 seconds, dealing Arcane damage. Deals reduced damage if striking the same target multiple times, prioritizes undamaged targets if in range. 10 yard range, 25s CD. Consumes 1-5 CP. Can consume up to 100 Ferocity to increase the number of slashes to 8 over 4 seconds.

*Maim changed*: Can consume up to 75 Ferocity to deal 30% bonus damage. On stun-immune targets causes a debuff that lowers the targets armor by 15%. Rest unchanged.

&#x200B;

Okay, so this would serve as the core rotational spells. I've wanted to open up some options and also make each spender meaningful in both PvP and PvE. The reintroduction of Ravage would once more allow for a more aggressive opener where currently only Rake exists. By giving Shred a CD and a recharger I was thinking the damage could be higher, placing more impact in each usage. Swipe and Moonfire are also present to compliment the rotation both in a ST, cleave and AoE scenario. 

With 4 different spenders we're also looking at each of them being distinct and meaningful. Arcane Slash to me should be a major damage option to use whenever available. Additionally we've once more got that mini-game interaction FB and the Rip effect to keep bleeds rolling and I always thought Maim could be a cool spell even in PvE scenarios. If a target is stun immune - such as a boss - I decided to take inspiration from the Open Wounds artifact talent from Legion and bake it in. This way we've got 4 spenders that are all important and gives us a variety between burst- and sustained AoE alongside burst ST. Anyways, let's move on.

&#x200B;

# CD's and Utility:

*Tiger's Fury adjusted*: Generates 2 CP and increases damage done by 15%. No longer snapshots. CD and duration unchanged.

*Berserk reworked*: The Druid goes Berserk, increasing the Critical Strike chance of themselves and all party- and raid members by 10%. In addition, the Druid gains 25% movement speed and Attack Speed. Lasts 30s, 3 min CD.

*Survival Instincts reworked*: In combat restores 10% of total health and increases movement speed by 10%. When out of combat, restores 40% total health. Does not break Prowl. Has 2 charges, 30s CD.

*Barkskin added*. Reduces damage taken by 20% for 12s, 1 min CD. Useable in Cat Form.

*Stampeding Roar*: Increases movement speed of all friendly targets within 30 yards (up from 15) for 8 seconds by 60%. 2 min CD.

*Wild Charge* (**Kitty leap only**) baseline.

&#x200B;

**NEW**: *Utility CD,* ***Elune's Judgment***. Incapacitates the target for 9 seconds, Removes Moonfire DoT. Requires Elune's Gaze. 2 min CD. 20 yard range.

**NEW**: *Utility CD,* ***Elune's Anger***. Immobilizes the target for 9 seconds. Can break on damage. Require's Elune's Gaze. 15s CD, 30 yard range.

**NEW** *Passive:* ***Ferocious Claws***. Your autoattacks generates 2 Ferocity. 

**NEW** *Passive:* ***Elune's Gaze***. Allows cast of Elune's Judgment and Elune's Anger. Applied from Moonfire.

*Infected Wounds changed*: Rake causes an Infected Wound in the target, reducing the target's movement speed and reduces healing received by 15% for 12s.

*Primal Fury slightly changed*: When you critically strike with an attack you generate 5 Ferocity and 1 CP.

*Mastery unchanged*. 

*Feline Adept unchanged*.

*Feline Swiftness unchanged*.

&#x200B;

This would be the bulk of it's active CD's, utilities and passives. This is intended as a means to replace Cyclone and Entangling Roots at a trade-off of being able to cast it in Cat Form while allowing for more counterplay from the otherwise spammy nature of Cyclone and Roots. By putting more consequence inside the previous power of spammable CC's, now they come with a drawback, it allows us to place more power inside the kitty elsewhere - it's mobility, damage and debuffs. 

This is intended to be a net buff in terms of damage and mobility but I want it to retain a deep sense of complexity in how you choose to spend your resources which can only be limited by your own creativity and imagination. I also thought it was a lot more fitting to have a ""lick-your-wounds"" style of healing rather than Regrowth which just felt a little odd to me. By allowing it's use in combat but a bit different it would allow you to sacrifice a potential defensive for an offensive gain - that is to reach your target quicker. This can also be a net DPS gain in PvE circumstances with heavy movement to setup bleeds and move out to quickly to avoid damage with minimal downtime. 

I also wanted Ferocious Claws and Elune's Gaze to be more thematic and controllable ways to spend your resources compared to Omen of Clarity and Predatory Swiftness.  In their current iteration both of these passives are fine but as my main desire with this is to change Feral's resource (of which I believe is a big reason why Feral often ends up being overpowered or underperforming depending on patch) I believe a more steady gain of resource is a lot healthier especially with this kind of dual resource management. I also would love to expand the underlying Arcane theme which became a bit more prominent since the Legion expansion and with Moonfire's current talent literally being ""Lunar Inspiration"" I thought it'd be really cool to combine the two as Arcane is inherently a very chaotic force in the lore, just like the ferocious jungle tiger.

&#x200B;

# Caster Form:

Rejuvenation, (Solar) Wrath, Moonfire, Remove Corruption, Abolish Poison, Soothe, Hibernation, Thorns, Mark of the Wild.

The caster form is intended to be very bland and basic - these are basically the most iconic Druid spells even if we go as far back as Warcraft 3 and the start of Classic. Now I don't think either of these abilities should be overly powerful, mostly there for thematic value. As in, you were taught these arts before deciding to specialize in the act of taking the form of a great *Kitty.* Still, there's some very valuable things in there such as curse, poison and enrage removal as well as my personal deep hope of Mark of the Wild being reintroduced baseline. Thorns is probably a stretch given it's niche in the PvP talents.

&#x200B;

These have been some of the thoughts I've had over the course of Legion and especially BfA given how the gameplay has felt. I've been wanting to share this for quite some time. I wrote a bit about it on the EU forums at one point but it wasn't really any interest and so now I decided to share it in more depth here on Reddit and see if any of you have some cool ideas. It'd be really cool to see some other takes on it, if you're an avid Druid fan or just wanting to get back into Kitty again what have you been thinking about? Any hopes for the upcoming expacs changes?

76,world of warcraft reborn,"  

Next wow expansion have the working title of ""reborn"", will be presented at blizzcon this year

Notable features:

\- No new landsmasses: adding new lands can't go on forever. Instead, we will have a remake of several Kalimdor/EK zones.

New world quests, new events, the world should feel more ""alive""

Exodar and Silvermoon will be added to the EK/Kalimdor servers (with flying), but not at launch

\- You will see the post legion effects on the world, like small pandaren villages, repair of the cataclysm damage, and so on

\- The team want to merge as many servers and battlegroups as possible, using scaling, layering and phasing to avoid overpopulating while making the main landmasses populated again. This, along the revamp of several old zones and the dynamic events should achieve the goal

\- Only real new zones are the dragon islands (see below). Technically you can level up there, but you'll probably run out of quests pretty soon

\- Wow need to return to his roots, fighting world ending threats every 6 months create too much power creep (also, all the notable big baddies are defeated, so they need to create new ones)

\- New threats should ramp up, from simple zone quest to a full raid over time, instead of popping out in a patch and be dealt within the same patch

\- Sylvanas and Mueh‚Äôzala will be dealt with a full patch, the idea is to make the battle as big as 8.3 n‚Äôzoth. The scarlet crusade will make a small return

\- The main idea of the expansion is to return to a time where the player are saving the world by stopping a Gnoll invasion that will wipe out Goldshire, or stop the overgrowth to take over desolace (all with events like invasions/n‚Äôzoth assault). There is A LOT of this stuff, mainly because the team can reuse assets

\- During prepatch Azeroth will go dormant/comatose, azerite will turn red and lose all the powers.  This is the lore excuse to lose the heart of azeroth. Unlike legion artifacts transmog, this time player won‚Äôt retail really anything from the heart of azeroth

\- The new ‚Äúgrind‚Äù will be the Dragonflight aspects. Basically we help them to regain some of their powers, so they can grant us new abilities. It looks like the current talent trees, most of the abilities are passive but some are actives.

Every aspect is focused in one role, but have some options for other roles. For example the Black dragonflight is for tanks, and have several tanks abilities, but also have some dps options; so if, say, Vengeance DH have the Black dragonflight, the moment he switches to Havoc he still have some abilities for damage dealing; player who want to optimize their character will level up 2-3 dragonflights, in the case of the DH he might want to level the Blue one for dps, or the bronze because it synergize better with his playstyle.

\- Having 5 different dragonflights will allow players to quickly access to all of the abilities of a single aspect (for new players and alts) and be fully functional, while more experienced players will level up 2 or 3 different dragonflights for a better min/maxing; ideally, you will full a single aspect while leveling to the new level cap, and it becomes more and more grindy as you level up more aspects

\- The dragon islands are build atop old gods temple, south of quel‚Äôdanas. Not very large, but filled with dragon lore. No flying there.

\- The team want to add a solo challenge for players who level up an aspect to max. The reward is the ability to turn into a dragon as a mount (like tarecgosa staff)

\- No new class, but a new neutral base race: Dragonkin. Despite the name, is a brand new race, new rig, new model, new animations. Looks like a d&d half dragon, with several customization options

\- Many new allied races will come in the future, like Vrykul 

\- The biggest disappointment, no class overhaul, but many tweaks here and there. The team is going to reintroduce some of the pruned abilities, but like 1 or 2 for each class. Fox example, warriors will get the wotlk shattering throw (the version with the debuff), and nothing else. The PR excuse will be that dragon aspects will provide all the new abilities needed to improve the gameplay, but if you don‚Äôt like the current version of, say, Retribution paladin, I doubt that having Turn Undead and a dragon breath on 45 sec CD will be that much of improvement‚Ä¶

\- Warmode will be expanded. Basically we have now ‚Äúfour factions‚Äù: Warmongering Alliance (lead by tyrande/genn), peaceful alliance (lead by anduin), peaceful horde (Baine side of the council) and warmongering horde (Talanji side of the council); the moment you turn warmode on you basically become part of warmongering side of your faction, in typical wow way: you can attack other players, different tag, and so on. If you disable the war mode you can play with the other peaceful faction, including quests, dungeon and raids. This leaves the lore reason for pvp battlegrounds and events, while also merging the two factions into one. Note that the AH will still be separated, and you cannot do mythic raids with other faction. Currently the team is still looking for a lore reason to remove the common/orcish language barrier

\- The team is tinkering with the idea of using islands AI into dungeons and events, but is afraid it might cause buggy and/or unbalanced result. Might not even be implement in alpha testing

\- Many 8.3 features are testing grounds for 9.0. Dungeons that scale 1 to 5 players, alternatives for Titanforging, powerful items with negative effects to higher skillcap, zones that ‚Äúphases‚Äù during events (like old gods influence over uldum and valley)

\- With party sync and scaling, the idea is to let new players/alt to participate in end game activities, like events and invasions

\- A level squish is in order, but for now is too buggy to be properly tested",1571164583.0,"world of warcraft reborn  

Next wow expansion have the working title of ""reborn"", will be presented at blizzcon this year

Notable features:

\- No new landsmasses: adding new lands can't go on forever. Instead, we will have a remake of several Kalimdor/EK zones.

New world quests, new events, the world should feel more ""alive""

Exodar and Silvermoon will be added to the EK/Kalimdor servers (with flying), but not at launch

\- You will see the post legion effects on the world, like small pandaren villages, repair of the cataclysm damage, and so on

\- The team want to merge as many servers and battlegroups as possible, using scaling, layering and phasing to avoid overpopulating while making the main landmasses populated again. This, along the revamp of several old zones and the dynamic events should achieve the goal

\- Only real new zones are the dragon islands (see below). Technically you can level up there, but you'll probably run out of quests pretty soon

\- Wow need to return to his roots, fighting world ending threats every 6 months create too much power creep (also, all the notable big baddies are defeated, so they need to create new ones)

\- New threats should ramp up, from simple zone quest to a full raid over time, instead of popping out in a patch and be dealt within the same patch

\- Sylvanas and Mueh‚Äôzala will be dealt with a full patch, the idea is to make the battle as big as 8.3 n‚Äôzoth. The scarlet crusade will make a small return

\- The main idea of the expansion is to return to a time where the player are saving the world by stopping a Gnoll invasion that will wipe out Goldshire, or stop the overgrowth to take over desolace (all with events like invasions/n‚Äôzoth assault).

115,Opinion: Continuing the Order Hall system would had been a cool way to experience the war campaign (and order halls are just cool in general),"Please note first that this isn't a ""BFA bad"" thread. I just really like Order Halls.

One problem I personally had with the war campaign (and with leveling alts) wasn't even necessarily the whole catch-up problem, it's that if I was playing on the same one of two factions, I'd go through the exact same experience. Meanwhile back in Legion if I had 12 characters, sure I'd have to go through the same zones and dungeons, I'd also have different order hall locations and campaigns to look forward to. This got me thinking about the war campaign since there's really only two sides you see through the war campaign -- even the Horde, split between Sylvanas and Saurfang, their war campaign plays out the same for the player no matter which side they picked. They just report back to Sylvanas if they're a loyalist. I get that that's in part because being a loyalist was supposedly a late last-minute edition, though I was thinking about how order halls and the war campaign could had been merged into something interesting.

Personally I would had liked to have seen three order halls for both factions. For the same of reputation we can just say they all contribute to the same generic 'Order Hall' reputation faction.

For the Alliance, there could be...

* ***the Alliance War Council*** - Generic Alliance war campaign. You fight in the name of the High King alongside SI:7, the Seventh Legion and related Alliance organizations. Your prime directive is to help the Alliance, led by Anduin Wrynn, defeat the Horde. Plain and simple enough. 

* ***the Army of the Black Moon*** - The Kalimdor side of the story that helps keep the night elves from being put on the backburner. You fight in the name of Tyrande Whisperwind alongside the Cenarion Circle, Sentinels, Gilneas and even support from the draenei. Your goal is revenge for Teldrassil. Some parts of the campaign take place in Kalimdor, particularly Darkshore. 

* ***the Kirin Tor*** - Non-war effort story focusing on healing Azeroth and eventually preventing the rise of N'Zoth. You fight in the name of the Archmage alongside the rest of the Kirin Tor and Tirisgarde. You're working to fight off the Old God's minions and try and stop his return (as the rest of the world 'fights like idiots'). While you're still targeted by the Horde, your focus here isn't at all on the war campaign. 

The potential factions for the Horde IMO are obvious and actually more interesting on the surface.

* ***the Horde War Effort*** - Generic Horde war campaign. You fight in the name of the Warchief alongside the rest of the loyal Horde. Your campaign goes back and forth between beating back the Alliance and squashing dissent being spread throughout the Horde. 

* ***the Saurfang Rebellion*** - The rebel-honor side of the story, of course. You fight in the name of Saurfang to preserve the 'honor of the Horde' and try and return the Horde to... honor. Your goal is to undermine Sylvanas, uphold... honor and to still protect the Horde against the Alliance offensive on all fronts in between.
* ***the Earthen Ring*** - Non-war effort story focusing on healing Azeroth and eventually preventing the rise of N'Zoth. The Horde equivalent of the Kirin Tor faction. I know both factions lore-wise are neutral during this, this is just for gameplay purposes. The Earthen Ring and Kirin Tor campaigns might blend together in certain areas kind of like the priest/paladin interactions in Legion. 

Would you have liked to see an order hall system in BFA? What order halls would you like to see as opposed to the ones I had in mind? Do you like order halls at all or should they go the way of the garrison?

>!Also, please Blizzard, if you haven't added order halls to 9.0 please consider them for 10.0.!<",1571138003.0,"Opinion: Continuing the Order Hall system would had been a cool way to experience the war campaign (and order halls are just cool in general)Please note first that this isn't a ""BFA bad"" thread. I just really like Order Halls.

One problem I personally had with the war campaign (and with leveling alts) wasn't even necessarily the whole catch-up problem, it's that if I was playing on the same one of two factions, I'd go through the exact same experience. Meanwhile back in Legion if I had 12 characters, sure I'd have to go through the same zones and dungeons, I'd also have different order hall locations and campaigns to look forward to. This got me thinking about the war campaign since there's really only two sides you see through the war campaign -- even the Horde, split between Sylvanas and Saurfang, their war campaign plays out the same for the player no matter which side they picked. They just report back to Sylvanas if they're a loyalist. I get that that's in part because being a loyalist was supposedly a late last-minute edition, though I was thinking about how order halls and the war campaign could had been merged into something interesting.

Personally I would had liked to have seen three order halls for both factions. For the same of reputation we can just say they all contribute to the same generic 'Order Hall' reputation faction. Keep in mind of course each campaign would take place in large part in Zandalar, Kul Tiras and later even Nazjatar to keep the expansion features working fine. >!I'm leaving exact order hall locations out since I know some people will hate the ideas in the first place and downvote just because of that, so adding locations people might not like is a sure-fire way of getting this post hidden.!<

129,Inconsistencies in the leaders of the races and lack of agency in the Patch 8.3,"Greetings everyone I want to share with you this feedback I made with my friends about the current lore. We saw a lot of inconsistency in many leaders and there are a lot of dialogues that feels truly OoC and displaced in time. I made a list for every race and I hope you liked.

**Horde**

**Orcs**: They barely have an opinion on the matter. Sure there are some dialogues in Orgrimmar about their division caused by the warchief but they never mention the alliance interfering in their politics or why Saurfang sided with the alliance instead of just challenge her to Mak‚Äôgora early during Lordaeron at the eyes of the rest of the horde leaders would had ended the war more sooner and saved more orcs lives. In other words they lack any agency beyond of being an extension of Go‚Äôel ‚Äì who abandoned them once more for selfish reasons. I hope with him being busy at the alliance council like government we can see new orcs characters that holds their disdain for the alliance but aren‚Äôt villain batted.

Another problem they have is how Go‚Äôel agrees with finishing an orcish institution that is legacy of his own people by the whims of Baine about ‚Äúpeace‚Äù

*Baine: That legacy must end. The war nearly cost us everything. There is no place for a warchief in a time of peace.*

*Thrall: It is true‚Äìthe Horde has changed. Our ranks have grown, and new voices have stepped forth to lead*

Getting rid of the warchief institution for a council is a total slap to the orcs and a horrible way to homogenize them to be humans when their culture they culture is totally distant of that and we know without a warchief to guide the orcish clans starts a lot of infighting. In face of the Old Gods or any exterior threat orcs would need a leader to rally command them and not a 21st century human wearing an orc suit.

\-Geya‚Äôrah ‚Äì This character became a meme, and it‚Äôs quite evident that writers had absolutely no clue how to write her. Her character flips can now compete with Jaina‚Äôs. This also shows how the writers needs to focus in old characters rather than create many that later they don‚Äôt know how to handle them and poof them out of existence a la Medan. We have guys like Nazgrel(he is in the legion pvp artifact skin which means Blizzard didn‚Äôt forget about him) and if we really needed a mag‚Äôhar orc from that timeline and female, then they could add Rulkhan or Draaka

Trolls and Zandalaris: They are ignored in all aspects. Ironically only Saurfang mentioned Dazae‚Äôalor back during the rescue of Baine and since them It was never brought by anyone ever again even by the person who was very personally involved with them such as Rokhan. He should be angry that not only the Horde sabotaged his efforts in fighting Alliance but also abandoning Zandalari - nobody is considering their loss and grievances. Whole BoD is being ignored and for worse he is being hit by amnesia bat and totally forgetting about Talanji and both fighted side by side in Nazmir(TWICE) and Zuldazar against Zul and the Alliance.

Another problem they are having is Rokhan basically saying ""meh I guess I should lead after the prep talk with Baine""

*-Rokhan: Since da death of Vol‚Äôjin, da Darkspear been lookin‚Äô ta me ta guide dem.*

\-*Rokhan: I been fightin‚Äô for dem a long, long time‚Ä¶ but dat don‚Äôt mean I deserve ta be deir chieftain.*

\-Baine: I felt much the same when my father died. It happened suddenly, and I feared that I was unprepared to take his place.

\-*Baine: But I was ready, just as you are. You proved that in Zuldazar and at Stromgarde. The Darkspear have faith in you, and so do I.*

\-*Rokhan: Heh. Ya best be stoppin‚Äô da flattery, Baine, before it be goin‚Äô ta me head.*

\-*Rokhan: But‚Ä¶ da Darkspear do be needin‚Äô a leader. A voice on da council. And if it gotta be me‚Ä¶ den it be me.*

All of this dialogue feels OoC for Rokhan, he should take initiative by his own and by the wish of the elders of his tribe. He shouldn‚Äôt be happy at all what happened to the Horde and that it‚Äôs members so eagerly collaborated with Alliance after BoD. He would take a role of councilor but who is having negative approach and begrudging attitude, taking a change in Darkspear approach ‚Äì from extreme loyalty to Horde to more autonomic leadership.

This dialogue is in DIRE need of being rephrased since this throw under bridge all the build up we did to forge an alliance with the Zandalari and now Blizzard wants to pretend like it didn‚Äôt happen?

Rokhan did fight in this war. He wanted to protect Troll land and the Horde. he helped Talanji, only to abandon her and to be sad about Saurfang? Why is he even listening to Baine, who helped Kul‚Äôtiras?  
Daelin and the Kul‚Äôtirans did try to wipe out the Darskpears. Was this forgotten? He can see it as necessity against Sylvanas and the free old god. But he should not be happy about it and not listen to Baine‚Äôs advise.

The same goes for the Revantusk. They said they want to pay their dept to the Horde and want to help the Zandalaris. But they are fine with the death of their king? I bet some of them died during the siege of Dazar‚Äôalor but seems they are forgotten as the wildhammer dwarves.

A more appropiate dialogue could be like this:

\-*Baine: ""But I was ready. Just as you are. You proved that in the battlefield. The Darkspear have faith in you, and so have I.*

\-*Rokhan: ‚ÄúEnoug‚Äô flattery. Dat was huntin‚Äô, den we had enemies‚Ä¶ Now we be havin‚Äô dis‚Ä¶ so-called ‚ÄúPeace‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Äù*

\-*Rokhan: ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ da Darkspear be neeidn‚Äô a leader. A voice on da council, and if it gonna be me‚Ä¶ den it be me.‚Äù*

This should be a more appropiate dialogue with both in character, he feels distrust of this arministice with all the bad blood that had been generated but at the same time Rokhan knows it‚Äôs better to move forward and make the best of the situation

Besides there should be at least one mention of him of going to visit Talanji in Zandalar or at least hint they had already met and are discussing things while he is seeing how the horde is being reformed again or else it feels like a total betray to her since Trolls are very into vengeance and it and let‚Äôs not forget the promise he did to the at that time Princess Talanji

https://i.imgur.com/Se0NYak.png

For a more deep analysis I leave this link:  
https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/what-are-you-doing-with-rokhan/94196

Taurens: Same as the orcs, they only have Baine and he is more an alliance character with a lot of inconsistencies, in one moment he wants to help the alliance because of his friendship with Anduin(kinda understandable) and hates to harm humans but then he praises Rokhan for his battles against them when moments before in the whole war campaign he was 100% against that

**Bfa Campaign:**

\-Baine: Sylvanas!

\-Baine: What reason could you possibly have for this madness?!

\-Baine: This is too far!

Now durinng the chat with Rokhan if he is ‚Äúworthy‚Äù to be part of the new council:

\-*Baine: But I was ready, just as you are. You proved that in Zuldazar and at Stromgarde. The Darkspear have faith in you, and so do I.*

This incosistency should be fixed with him finally breaking apart his alliance bounds and embracing the horde or like I said in the troll part, Rokhan actually taking iniciative and cutting that dialogue between him and Baine

Blood Elves: Despite their small screen-time in this expansion, they suffered a lot with some of their character being butchered. Firstly they are forced to see how Theron became some Jaina apologist and even forgetting what she did in Dalaran and for worse in the rescue of Baine you are forced to defend her from Sunreavers survivors. He decides to throw himself with Anduin despite of previously refusing his invitation to join the alliance and outright mock his nickname ""The boy king"" . Here is the dialogue that feels OoC:

\-Lor‚Äôthemar: One question remains. Who will serve as warchief? Perhaps, you, Thrall, would‚Äì

\-Lor‚Äôthemar: Though the Horde has changed through the years‚Äìfor good or ill‚Äìour people have always looked to a warchief to guide us forward.

This was never the case, the blood elves never saw the warchief as something to look guidance but they always helped the horde for gratitud and duty. Also it‚Äôs hilarious

\-Lord‚Äôthamar propose Thrall as the warchief considering he at the beginning didn‚Äôt wanted them in his horde and outright considerer them ‚Äúweak‚Äù if it wasn‚Äôt for Sylvanas doing the leg work, they would had never joined the horde.

I believe the dialogue should be changed into something like this:

*Lor‚Äôthemar: One question remains. Who will serve as warchief? However I vote myself out, my people need me full time*

That would be more in character for him dedicating to his people and showing his lack of ambition which is the mark of his character not the boot licker of Thrall

Forsaken: They were butchered to no end. First they lose their main leader and second most developed character. Now they are leaderess and without knowing who is still with them from the previous chain of leadership(Belmont, Faranell and Velonara are MIA). There is a threat of Calia in the horizon with heavy chances of taking leadership while silencing and destroying the 15 years old characterization and identity of the forsaken. Some may argue getting stuck in the gothic/emo phase isn‚Äôt good but doing a 180¬∞ change just because of some pet character of a writer is not a good idea. Also we have this

*Calia: Miss Voss I once heard listened to your father‚Äôs sermon once.*

Ok that alone should trigger Lilian or at least she should respond that with some snide remark to Calia status *""Not everyone is supported by their family or raised by the light, Ex-Princess Calia""*

Then we have this jewel:

Lilian: *This champion has witnessed your kindness to Lord Proudmoore and how you help him go through his torment*

Ok I really hope that changes because neither the champion ever saw that kindness besides of a peak in the aftermath of the war campaign and only being nice to a recently raised human that was supported by his family is enough to be leader? That is total crap


**Alliance**

Humans and Kul‚Äôtirans: They have a grudge with the Horde since the death of Daelin and he is considered one of their greatest national heroes despite of what Anduin or Jaina might say of him. There should be some political turmoil that is asking to Jaina and her ‚Äúhigh king‚Äù to continue with the war and dismantle the horde after N‚Äôzoth is being deal with or negotiate a better treaty rather than a vague arministice. Now they seem to be just extensions of Jaina and ignoring she did this same trick in the past when her father died. I don‚Äôt see why asking for better terms of peace should be terrible

Night elves: The fact that none of them speaks about how the alliance forsook them in their thirst of vengeance while Anduin doesn‚Äôt address any of their problem of territory(Ashenvale and Darkshore aren‚Äôt mentioned anywhere) and seems like everything will be sweep under the rug because having the High King care about non humans but also referring to portray him in a bad light and just whitewash his hands seems to be the fetish of the current writers. Also we have this little gem of dialogue

Tyrande talking with Shandris later on

\*-Shandris: You spoke harshly to King Anduin, Tyrande. The kaldorei can ill afford to shun the Alliance. They have provided aid and comfort to us in these dark times.

\-Tyrande: The young king is foolish to trust our enemies. Harsh words should be the least of his fears.

\-Shandris: The Banshee Queen no longer leads the Horde. Those who do seem more inclined toward peace than war.

\-Tyrande: If the wolf is rabid, it matters not who rides it. Sooner or later, the beast will bare its fangs.

\-Shandris: You are dearest to my heart, Tyrande. I beg you, let go of the Black Moon‚Äôs rage and embrace the mother‚Äôs light once again. I could not bear to lose you to darkness.

\-Tyrande: Know this. My hunger for vengeance will not be sated so long as Sylvanas Windrunner remains free‚Äìand until I know why Elune abandoned her children.

Shandris: Tyrande! Do not say such‚Äì

\-Tyrande: I will tarry no longer in this city of men. Let us leave for the boughs of Nordrassil.

\-Tyrande: From there we will dispatch the Sentinels to every corner of Azeroth. Let no one rest until the Banshee is found!\*

Ok so being harsh with the boy king that gave bad intelligence to the Kaldorei which made them move all their army to Silithus which was the main cause they lose during the Horde assault in their lands and the main reason why even the burning of their city happened in the first place‚Ä¶seems like an insult to the common sense

.

Honestly I would like if the dialogue is simplified to this

\*-Tyrande: The ""King"" deserverd harsher words but right now all I care is to find the Banshee. I would search with my sentinels every corner of this world and I will not rest until I find her.

\-Shandris: I would stay here gather more information.

\-Tyrande: Good, report me the next movements of this ""alliance"". Lets us discover their true face.

Something in the lines of this could easily represent the feelings of the nelf community of players that are having currently with the alliance, persecuting and their leader Anduin which is probably shared by many while Shandris could be the ones that only wants to move forward and aren‚Äôt interesting in the war

Now touching a topic controversial, the undead sentinels:

https://youtu.be/Q\_iOHIMACKk?t=268

Despite Tyrande begging them to rejoin to her, Delaryn and others choosed to continue with the forsakens and now It seems they are part of the horde since the undeads and loyalist that remained in the horde swore an oath of loyalty. But the most troublesome thing is that they needed **CALIA** to give them a prep talk instead actually trying to join with their High Priestess back but nope, only humans seems to able to convince people to follow them and indoctrinating them with a faith that is totally alien to night elves.

Dwarves and Dark Irons: The dark irons and the rest of their kind are left in the shadows again without no opinion. This is lazy since the dwarves and especially the dark irons were important in this war and at least they should voice their concerns about this arministice, they can suffer the same fate as the night elves if they aren‚Äôt careful.

TL;DR: In summary a lot of characters are acting like they weren‚Äôt themselves and you can see from a distance how forced they had been written to push this narrative. Blaming everything in Sylvanas and everyone speaking like it was some support group that everyone has to nod their head and the fews that object are treated like Lunatics while ignoring their races agenda. They homogenized every race into goody two shoes humans that are portraying modern 21th century morality and talk. This is truly an insult not only to the common sense but to us as **CUSTOMER**.

Please don‚Äôt do this World of Warcraft is wide and amazing franchise with plenty of exotic races, don‚Äôt make them only look different, you‚Äôre making the experience flat and uninspiring. Diversity should be WoW‚Äôs strenght.

\-*Baine: But I was ready, just as you are. You proved that in Zuldazar and at Stromgarde. The Darkspear have faith in you, and so do I.*

\-*Rokhan: Heh. Ya best be stoppin‚Äô da flattery, Baine, before it be goin‚Äô ta me head.*

\-*Rokhan: But‚Ä¶ da Darkspear do be needin‚Äô a leader. A voice on da council. And if it gotta be me‚Ä¶ den it be me.*

All of this dialogue feels OoC for Rokhan, he should take initiative by his own and by the wish of the elders of his tribe. He shouldn‚Äôt be happy at all what happened to the Horde and that it‚Äôs members so eagerly collaborated with Alliance after BoD. He would take a role of councilor but who is having negative approach and begrudging attitude, taking a change in Darkspear approach ‚Äì from extreme loyalty to Horde to more autonomic leadership.

This dialogue is in DIRE need of being rephrased since this throw under bridge all the build up we did to forge an alliance with the Zandalari and now Blizzard wants to pretend like it didn‚Äôt happen?

Rokhan did fight in this war. He wanted to protect Troll land and the Horde. he helped Talanji, only to abandon her and to be sad about Saurfang? Why is he even listening to Baine, who helped Kul‚Äôtiras?  
Daelin and the Kul‚Äôtirans did try to wipe out the Darskpears. Was this forgotten? He can see it as necessity against Sylvanas and the free old god. But he should not be happy about it and not listen to Baine‚Äôs advise.

The same goes for the Revantusk. They said they want to pay their dept to the Horde and want to help the Zandalaris. But they are fine with the death of their king? I bet some of them died during the siege of Dazar‚Äôalor but seems they are forgotten as the wildhammer dwarves.

A more appropiate dialogue could be like this:

\-*Baine: ""But I was ready. Just as you are. You proved that in the battlefield. The Darkspear have faith in you, and so have I.*

\-*Rokhan: ‚ÄúEnoug‚Äô flattery. Dat was huntin‚Äô, den we had enemies‚Ä¶ Now we be havin‚Äô dis‚Ä¶ so-called ‚ÄúPeace‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Äù*

\-*Rokhan: ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ da Darkspear be neeidn‚Äô a leader. A voice on da council, and if it gonna be me‚Ä¶ den it be me.‚Äù*

This should be a more appropiate dialogue with both in character, he feels distrust of this arministice with all the bad blood that had been generated but at the same time Rokhan knows it‚Äôs better to move forward and make the best of the situation

Besides there should be at least one mention of him of going to visit Talanji in Zandalar or at least hint they had already met and are discussing things while he is seeing how the horde is being reformed again or else it feels like a total betray to her since Trolls are very into vengeance and it and let‚Äôs not forget the promise he did to the at that time Princess Talanji

For a more deep analysis I leave this link:  
https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/what-are-you-doing-with-rokhan/94196

Taurens: Same as the orcs, they only have Baine and he is more an alliance character with a lot of inconsistencies, in one moment he wants to help the alliance because of his friendship with Anduin(kinda understandable) and hates to harm humans but then he praises Rokhan for his battles against them when moments before in the whole war campaign he was 100% against that

**Bfa Campaign:**

\-Baine: Sylvanas!

\-Baine: What reason could you possibly have for this madness?!

\-Baine: This is too far!

Now durinng the chat with Rokhan if he is ‚Äúworthy‚Äù to be part of the new council:

\-*Baine: But I was ready, just as you are. You proved that in Zuldazar and at Stromgarde. The Darkspear have faith in you, and so do I.*

This incosistency should be fixed with him finally breaking apart his alliance bounds and embracing the horde or like I said in the troll part, Rokhan actually taking iniciative and cutting that dialogue between him and Baine

Blood Elves: Despite their small screen-time in this expansion, they suffered a lot with some of their character being butchered. Firstly they are forced to see how Theron became some Jaina apologist and even forgetting what she did in Dalaran and for worse in the rescue of Baine you are forced to defend her from Sunreavers survivors. He decides to throw himself with Anduin despite of previously refusing his invitation to join the alliance and outright mock his nickname ""The boy king"" . Here is the dialogue that feels OoC:

\-Lor‚Äôthemar: One question remains. Who will serve as warchief? Perhaps, you, Thrall, would‚Äì

\-Lor‚Äôthemar: Though the Horde has changed through the years‚Äìfor good or ill‚Äìour people have always looked to a warchief to guide us forward.

This was never the case, the blood elves never saw the warchief as something to look guidance but they always helped the horde for gratitud and duty. Also it‚Äôs hilarious

\-Lord‚Äôthamar propose Thrall as the warchief considering he at the beginning didn‚Äôt wanted them in his horde and outright considerer them ‚Äúweak‚Äù if it wasn‚Äôt for Sylvanas doing the leg work, they would had never joined the horde.

I believe the dialogue should be changed into something like this:

*Lor‚Äôthemar: One question remains. Who will serve as warchief? However I vote myself out, my people need me full time*

That would be more in character for him dedicating to his people and showing his lack of ambition which is the mark of his character not the boot licker of Thrall

Forsaken: They were butchered to no end. First they lose their main leader and second most developed character. Now they are leaderess and without knowing who is still with them from the previous chain of leadership(Belmont, Faranell and Velonara are MIA). There is a threat of Calia in the horizon with heavy chances of taking leadership while silencing and destroying the 15 years old characterization and identity of the forsaken. Some may argue getting stuck in the gothic/emo phase isn‚Äôt good but doing a 180¬∞ change just because of some pet character of a writer is not a good idea. Also we have this

*Calia: Miss Voss I once heard listened to your father‚Äôs sermon once.*

Ok that alone should trigger Lilian or at least she should respond that with some snide remark to Calia status *""Not everyone is supported by their family or raised by the light, Ex-Princess Calia""*

Then we have this jewel:

Lilian: *This champion has witnessed your kindness to Lord Proudmoore and how you help him go through his torment*

Ok I really hope that changes because neither the champion ever saw that kindness besides of a peak in the aftermath of the war campaign and only being nice to a recently raised human that was supported by his family is enough to be leader? That is total crap


**Alliance**

Humans and Kul‚Äôtirans: They have a grudge with the Horde since the death of Daelin and he is considered one of their greatest national heroes despite of what Anduin or Jaina might say of him. There should be some political turmoil that is asking to Jaina and her ‚Äúhigh king‚Äù to continue with the war and dismantle the horde after N‚Äôzoth is being deal with or negotiate a better treaty rather than a vague arministice. Now they seem to be just extensions of Jaina and ignoring she did this same trick in the past when her father died. I don‚Äôt see why asking for better terms of peace should be terrible

Night elves: The fact that none of them speaks about how the alliance forsook them in their thirst of vengeance while Anduin doesn‚Äôt address any of their problem of territory(Ashenvale and Darkshore aren‚Äôt mentioned anywhere) and seems like everything will be sweep under the rug because having the High King care about non humans but also referring to portray him in a bad light and just whitewash his hands seems to be the fetish of the current writers. Also we have this little gem of dialogue

Tyrande talking with Shandris later on

\*-Shandris: You spoke harshly to King Anduin, Tyrande. The kaldorei can ill afford to shun the Alliance. They have provided aid and comfort to us in these dark times.

\-Tyrande: The young king is foolish to trust our enemies. Harsh words should be the least of his fears.

\-Shandris: The Banshee Queen no longer leads the Horde. Those who do seem more inclined toward peace than war.

\-Tyrande: If the wolf is rabid, it matters not who rides it. Sooner or later, the beast will bare its fangs.

\-Shandris: You are dearest to my heart, Tyrande. I beg you, let go of the Black Moon‚Äôs rage and embrace the mother‚Äôs light once again. I could not bear to lose you to darkness.

\-Tyrande: Know this. My hunger for vengeance will not be sated so long as Sylvanas Windrunner remains free‚Äìand until I know why Elune abandoned her children.

Shandris: Tyrande! Do not say such‚Äì

\-Tyrande: I will tarry no longer in this city of men. Let us leave for the boughs of Nordrassil.

\-Tyrande: From there we will dispatch the Sentinels to every corner of Azeroth. Let no one rest until the Banshee is found!\*

Ok so being harsh with the boy king that gave bad intelligence to the Kaldorei which made them move all their army to Silithus which was the main cause they lose during the Horde assault in their lands and the main reason why even the burning of their city happened in the first place‚Ä¶seems like an insult to the common sense

.

Honestly I would like if the dialogue is simplified to this

\*-Tyrande: The ""King"" deserverd harsher words but right now all I care is to find the Banshee. I would search with my sentinels every corner of this world and I will not rest until I find her.

\-Shandris: I would stay here gather more information.

\-Tyrande: Good, report me the next movements of this ""alliance"". Lets us discover their true face.

Something in the lines of this could easily represent the feelings of the nelf community of players that are having currently with the alliance, persecuting and their leader Anduin which is probably shared by many while Shandris could be the ones that only wants to move forward and aren‚Äôt interesting in the war

Now touching a topic controversial, the undead sentinels:

https://youtu.be/Q\_iOHIMACKk?t=268

Despite Tyrande begging them to rejoin to her, Delaryn and others choosed to continue with the forsakens and now It seems they are part of the horde since the undeads and loyalist that remained in the horde swore an oath of loyalty. But the most troublesome thing is that they needed **CALIA** to give them a prep talk instead actually trying to join with their High Priestess back but nope, only humans seems to able to convince people to follow them and indoctrinating them with a faith that is totally alien to night elves.

Dwarves and Dark Irons: The dark irons and the rest of their kind are left in the shadows again without no opinion. This is lazy since the dwarves and especially the dark irons were important in this war and at least they should voice their concerns about this arministice, they can suffer the same fate as the night elves if they aren‚Äôt careful.

TL;DR: In summary a lot of characters are acting like they weren‚Äôt themselves and you can see from a distance how forced they had been written to push this narrative. Blaming everything in Sylvanas and everyone speaking like it was some support group that everyone has to nod their head and the fews that object are treated like Lunatics while ignoring their races agenda. They homogenized every race into goody two shoes humans that are portraying modern 21th century morality and talk. This is truly an insult not only to the common sense but to us as **CUSTOMER**.

Please don‚Äôt do this World of Warcraft is wide and amazing franchise with plenty of exotic races, don‚Äôt make them only look different, you‚Äôre making the experience flat and uninspiring. Diversity should be WoW‚Äôs strenght.

132,Next Allied Race: Old Gods üêô,"# INTRODUCTION

Old Gods! It seems like nobody cares enough about our big tentacle-y friends, but why? These beautiful creatures are masterful tacticians, glorious conquerors, and will destroy anyone who stands in our way.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here today to propose to you a fantastic idea: let‚Äôs enlist the Old Gods into our ranks as the next playable allied race.

# LORE BEHIND THE OLD GODS


The Old Gods were sent down by their void-y masters, the void lords, to wreak havoc on Azeroth. Four of them zoomed through the Great Dark Beyond and got comfy on Azeroth, forcing different races to build things for them. They also fought silly little wars with each other which would end up killing millions, but hey. It‚Äôs just another planet.

Oh, and their playmate Y‚Äôshaarj abruptly got taken away from the fun that the four Old Gods were having. Some say it was a titan, but the Old Gods still think it was one of those strangers that the void lords told them not to talk to.

The three remaining Old Gods, C‚ÄôThun, Yogg-Saron and N‚ÄôZoth were all imprisoned deep inside Azeroth when the big bad stranger told his kiddos that they can‚Äôt just let the Old Gods run around anymore.

Aman‚Äôthul and his posse are actually facing child abuse charges, but they just pretended like everything was okay and it went away eventually.

Fast-forward like thousands of years, and N‚ÄôZoth and his goofy little thoughts actually came in handy, as the titans put him a little too close to Azeroth‚Äôs core when they yeeted him into the ocean. Because of this, he controlled Azeroth‚Äôs mannerisms, and forced her to tell Magni to fill up this random artifact that she gave him through telepathy so it could free him.

And now we‚Äôre here.

# RACIAL THINGS AND ABILITIES

Here‚Äôs some racial traits, abilities and special information that we might want to know about the Old Gods.

1. **Language**: The Old Gods speak Shath‚Äôyar. Are they trying to talk, or are they having a seizure? Who knows?
2. **Only Three Players Can Be Old Gods**: Only three players can be Old Gods, as there‚Äôs only three known Old Gods on Azeroth who are still alive 'n kicking. Sorry, ERPers.

Now, here‚Äôs the list of racials that you‚Äôve all been waiting for:

1. **Destroy Everything**: Break out of your childhood prison and literally destroy everything, corrupting the game files and putting an end to WoW‚Äôs 15-year tenure on the MMORPG market.
2. **Time for Tentacles**: A loss-of-control racial ability. Sprout double the tentacles, striking fear into the hearts of your enemies and a charm effect into the hearts of ERPers.
3. **Raise an Empire**: Turn the entire world into the Black Empire. Fry the ocean and enslave everybody, for better or for worse.

# POSSIBLE CLASSES


1. Death Knight: I know they‚Äôre afraid of death, but Yogg-Saron has proved time and time again that Old Gods can love it.
2. Demon Hunter: They even sprout little wings when they need to jump off cliffs.
3. Druid: As our friend Mortis put it, Nyan‚Äôlotha does indeed exist. Even N‚ÄôZoth becomes a cat. I‚Äôd love to see that.
4. Monk: Their Spinning Crane Kick is especially potent.
5. Paladin: Yogg-Saron didn‚Äôt tell you? He stole Arthas‚Äô armor and hammer when he went to Northrend.
6. Rogue: N‚ÄôZoth was forced to stay under the ocean blue for thousands of years. He saw way too many pirate ships passing overhead to not want to be a pirate.
7. Shaman: Easy. Just enslave all of the elementals again and use them as battle pets. There‚Äôd be a new specialization called ‚ÄòEnslaver.‚Äô
8. Warrior: Comes equipped with a dinky little helmet to top off C‚ÄôThun‚Äôs eyeball.

# CUSTOMIZATION


1. Skin: From the wonderful Black Empire Black to the Void Lord Purple, there‚Äôs plenty of skin colors to splurt onto the Old Gods. They might not like it though.
2. Eyes: A bunch, big, and none (for N‚ÄôZoth, C‚ÄôThun and Yogg-Saron respectively).
3. Hair Styles: Who said C‚ÄôThun didn‚Äôt want to try some hair growth products on that bald eye of his? Also, N‚ÄôZoth is sure to go emo after he gets the sh*t beat out of him after tolerating Azshara for 10,000 years.
4. Hair Colors: Void purple, void black, as well as void gray for when your Old God gets a little too old.
5. Tattoos: Specifically Yoggy <3‚Äôs Ner‚Äôzhul.
6. Facial Hair: To give your Old God that ‚Äòdaddy‚Äô look. There‚Äôs an optional dad bod option alongside this feature to show that our little Old Gods really have grown up.

# RECRUITMENT SCENARIO, MOUNT, AND ARMOR

1. Scenario: Work with N‚ÄôZoth, C‚ÄôThun and Yogg-Saron to corrupt Azeroth. Why? The developers get it. Even the players are tired of this damned planet.
2. Mount: The planet. This is probably the biggest mount we‚Äôve seen yet, but the Cosmic Longboi is also coming in 9.0, so that could change.
3. Heritage Armor: They‚Äôve been hiding their costumes that the void lords stitched for them because they‚Äôre too embarrassed to put them on. The denizens of Azeroth have come out in support of the Old Gods, though, so they‚Äôll feel comfortable in their wonderful regalia.

I believe in the next expansion we'll combine the factions while at the same time having remnants of the current factions led by those who have grudges and/or other motivations for not wanting to merge. Players would get a choice in which side they join and maybe have chances to switch sides with a penalty to reputation or something. Let's take a look at the possible leaders in each.

Citizens of Azeroth (combined):

Horde reps: 

Thrall - Green Mr. Rogers wants everybody to be his neighbor.

Baine - Pretty cool with playing nice. Saved Jaina's bro, was saved by a couple humans. Generally chill.

Rohkan - Kinda just goes with the flow. Maybe Vol'jin will tell him to play nice.

Loth'remar - Been working on the Saurfang side of things. Pushed for cooperation in Naz'jatar.

Callia and Derek - Pretty sure for what I've read they're taking over the Forsaken. Also, Alliance.

Gazlowe - Got a promotion, probably a lot of gold opportunities with double the customers.

&#x200B;

Alliance reps:

Anduin - Dude is Thrall.

Shandris - The only night elf leader person at SoO 2.0

Velen - I mean, he was pretty cool with us being on his space ship in Legion.

Overspark - Had to work with the goblins on Mechagon. See Mekkatorque below.

Jaina - She's an actual leader now AND she's friendly with some Horde boys again.

Tessa - Just because I think they'd want to have reps from each of the core races at least. Genn ain't it for worgen. Might see her shine in the heritage armor quest. Didn't read it myself.

Some Dwarf - Look, this is lazy, but with a council, it could split in a few ways. I doubt Magni would step up to it since he's Speaker now. Probably Muradin?

&#x200B;

Now for the Forsaken Horde

Sylvanas - Still the Warchief in some people's eyes.

Gallywix - Probably figures war is more profitable, sticking with who he knows will buy.

Magatha - Hates the Bloodhoofs. Likely would side against them in this scenario.

Talanji - Alliance invaded her city and killed her father. It's either here or neutral.

Geya'rah - Even though she saw Sylvanas without honor at the end of the war, she was cool with what she was doing until then and her people were taken in when Sylvanas was Warchief. Good analog for Thrall (alternate universe versions). No current Orcs would otherwise fit here.

Some blood elf? - Really drawing a blank here. Don't see Liadrin or any other high profile blood elf going to this side.

&#x200B;

And now the Fractured Alliance

Genn - Cannot, will not forgive the Horde for what Sylvanas did. Is a king, is now THE king.

Tyrande and Malfurion - Horde can't catch a break with all of Sylvanas' war crimes. Them here is why we see Shandris more.

Danath - Really doesn't like orcs. Horde's been assaulting his home all expansion.

Mekkatorque - Got mortally wounded at Dazar'alor, is getting an Iron Man heart which might affect his emotions or something? I don't know, WoW lore reasons.

Turalyon - No draenei I can think of  that wouldn't follow Velen, but some light-forged and maybe some of their non-light-forged buddies would follow Turalyon. We did work together in Legion, but since has defended Stromgarde against the Horde and we won't know where his head is at til after BfA. Also might dislike orcs the way Danath does.

Some Dwarf - Moira was put in line by Varian, so would probably follow Anduin so I don't think her. Maybe Kurdran just for being buddies with Danath and Turalyon.

It's kinda hard to place leaders for a few races just because some just killed off most of their high profile characters or just don't have any that are at odds with the current leaderships. Like, trolls, Darkspear specifically. Most that you would name just aren't famous enough to really be the opposition for Rokhan. Same goes for draenei.

I didn't really place allied race leaders unless I really thought of it. Most of them would probably just claim neutral and just give their people the freedom to do whatever. A few of them were helped out by both sides.

Mostly I've been playing around with this idea because:

1) It's fun.

2) Blizz has been seemingly trying to introduce more characters as high profile.

A good deal of these aren't solid, some aren't even filled. But do they need to be? If you were a blood elf that was against peace, would you NEED a famous blood elf on that side to join, or hell, just say Sylvanas is/was an elf, good enough? I don't know. As I said I think the peaceful side should have reps from each core race, but the war sides probably don't if they have conviction.

Tessa - Just because I think they'd want to have reps from each of the core races at least. Genn ain't it for worgen. Might see her shine in the heritage armor quest. Didn't read it myself.

Some Dwarf - Look, this is lazy, but with a council, it could split in a few ways. I doubt Magni would step up to it since he's Speaker now. Probably Muradin?

&#x200B;

Now for the Forsaken Horde

Sylvanas - Still the Warchief in some people's eyes.

Gallywix - Probably figures war is more profitable, sticking with who he knows will buy.

Magatha - Hates the Bloodhoofs. Likely would side against them in this scenario.

Talanji - Alliance invaded her city and killed her father. It's either here or neutral.

Geya'rah - Even though she saw Sylvanas without honor at the end of the war, she was cool with what she was doing until then and her people were taken in when Sylvanas was Warchief. Good analog for Thrall (alternate universe versions). No current Orcs would otherwise fit here.

Some blood elf? - Really drawing a blank here. Don't see Liadrin or any other high profile blood elf going to this side.

&#x200B;

And now the Fractured Alliance

Genn - Cannot, will not forgive the Horde for what Sylvanas did. Is a king, is now THE king.

Tyrande and Malfurion - Horde can't catch a break with all of Sylvanas' war crimes. Them here is why we see Shandris more.

Danath - Really doesn't like orcs. Horde's been assaulting his home all expansion.

Mekkatorque - Got mortally wounded at Dazar'alor, is getting an Iron Man heart which might affect his emotions or something? I don't know, WoW lore reasons.

Turalyon - No draenei I can think of  that wouldn't follow Velen, but some light-forged and maybe some of their non-light-forged buddies would follow Turalyon. We did work together in Legion, but since has defended Stromgarde against the Horde and we won't know where his head is at til after BfA. Also might dislike orcs the way Danath does.

Some Dwarf - Moira was put in line by Varian, so would probably follow Anduin so I don't think her. Maybe Kurdran just for being buddies with Danath and Turalyon.

It's kinda hard to place leaders for a few races just because some just killed off most of their high profile characters or just don't have any that are at odds with the current leaderships. Like, trolls, Darkspear specifically. Most that you would name just aren't famous enough to really be the opposition for Rokhan. Same goes for draenei.

I didn't really place allied race leaders unless I really thought of it. Most of them would probably just claim neutral and just give their people the freedom to do whatever. A few of them were helped out by both sides.

Mostly I've been playing around with this idea because:

1) It's fun.

2) Blizz has been seemingly trying to introduce more characters as high profile.

A good deal of these aren't solid, some aren't even filled. But do they need to be? If you were a blood elf that was against peace, would you NEED a famous blood elf on that side to join, or hell, just say Sylvanas is/was an elf, good enough? I don't know. As I said I think the peaceful side should have reps from each core race, but the war sides probably don't if they have conviction.

Let me know what you think. Who goes where. Who am I not thinking of. How full of it am I.",1

Class wise, I could totally see them rocking Warrior, Rogue, Hunter, Shaman, Druid, and *maybe* Mage. I could maybe see a case made for Warlocks, if you played up the humor, with demons *willingly* going along with the Gnolls' demands, but that would be kind of a stretch.

A NEW WAY TO PLAY    

* Join a duel with players from different realms! You can find the duel option in the interface or by clicking on the 'Play' button. 
* Once a duel has started, players can either leave the server or pick a random player to duel. 
*  The current duel player receives a debuff that will prevent him or her from using abilities for 3 seconds.
* A new debuff will prevent the next melee attack from being able to be dodged or parried.
*  The current duel player receives a debuff that will prevent a heal from being used

The server will try to reunite players at the start of a duel. If not possible, players will be given a time to try to get back into the server. Once a player is in the server, players will have 10 seconds to rejoin the duel. If they cannot, the server will try to find another player to fight for them. 

Should a player be in the server and unable to fight, the party leader will get a ring notification indicating that the player is stuck in a duel.

* If a player is in a duel and tries to leave, the server will look for a player who can give up a duel to a player who can not, and automatically assume that the player is stuck.
* The server will try to establish a duel by asking the party, ""Who are you fighting?"" Players will get a choice of responses: ""None,"" ""Myself,"" ""Someone else,"" and ""I'm stuck."" Players will get a shout-out if they are ""In A Queue."" 
* The server will use the best available information to determine who has the upper hand.         

 Upon entering a queue, players will be given the option to enter the duel ""Local Leader."" 

* If Local Leader is selected, players will be given a choice of whether to engage the other player in

A NEW WAY TO PLAY

&#x200B;

After months of work, World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth is now available to test your combat abilities. PvP elements will remain unchanged while the core game system is improved.

In this new test, you'll fight against other players from around the world. We want to make sure that the PvP gameplay you have in mind is for the core game, and not in the expansion. We've been hard at work polishing up the core systems, adding new features, and tuning in all the best PvP moments.

Stay tuned for an expansion full of new battles and adventures!

&#x200B;

NEW WORLD BOSSES

In a new, and very limited, way, you can face off against other players from around the world. You'll be matched up against one another, against a computer simulation of the battle, for a limited period of time. During this period, you'll gain experience and gold based on your performance, both in PvP and PvE. 

You can then ask to be removed from the simulation, and leave the game. We hope this new and exciting direction for the game takes us by surprise. Stay tuned for an expansion full of new battles and adventures!

&#x200B;

NEW CHARACTER MODELS

The models for the races from the original game (white, paladin, etc.), along with a few others, have been changed to be more in keeping with the expansion's theme. The main change here is that the skins have been changed. Instead of having standard class skins, which were very limited in their ability to be fun, players now have the opportunity to choose from a larger selection of class skins. Additionally, we've buffed and clarified a few core concepts. Overall, this brings the amount of customization available to the game up to a level that the expansion felt like a premium product.

All of the above applies to the regular Forsaken, Druids, and Balance druids. You'll retain your existing 15% spell power (which we did not intend), and the new flavor will be available to Experiment (as intended) with.

In the meantime, we wanted to make sure players understood the reasoning for the change to class-specific skins. After all, these skins have been chosen primarily for their aesthetic appeal. Furthermore, we've seen players complain about the difficulty of gaining Trueheart in Season 3 (before the Patch 7.1 changes), so we decided to take matters into our own hands and make changes to the game for the expansion.

NEW DUNGEON FINDER     

* Dungeon Finder now has a look and feel to it that makes it easier to navigate. Players can now click on any dungeon objective to get a quick overview of what the next step should look like.



NEW DUNGEON HALLOW'S END

* A new graveyard has been added to the world.

* \[Kirin Torporium\] should only be used by very, very, very, very, very rarely.
* \[Rainbow Six

====================

A NEW WAY TO PLAY

   

* New playstyles are now available for all classes. You can find them in the Appearance tab of the Character Selection screen.
* Character animation easing is now turned on for players. This is an individual setting that can be turned off in the Interface Options menu.

   

   NEW DUNGEONS AND RAIDS

   

*  A new zone is now available in Northern Stranglethorn Vale. Known as Booty Bay, this new zone offers a heroic combat zone with a healthy dose of mystery. Adventurers should take note that Booty Bay is not associated with the current expansion content.

&#x200B;

PVP

Stranglethorn Vale has received several significant changes. 

* All characters on a realm have the option to participate in PvP. 
* Each character has the following abilities: 
   * Attack power
   * Cast animation
   * Dodge and Parry
   * Weapon damage
   * Healing and self-sustain

In the meantime, we wanted to make sure players understood the reasoning for the change to class-specific skins. After all, these skins have been chosen primarily for their aesthetic appeal. Furthermore, we've seen players complain about the difficulty of gaining Trueheart in Season 3 (before the Patch 7.1 changes), so we decided to take matters into our own hands and make changes to the game for the expansion.

* New playstyles are now available for all classes. You can find them in the Appearance tab of the Character Selection screen.

   NEW DUNGEONS AND RAIDS

   

*  A new zone is now available in Northern Stranglethorn Vale. Known as Booty Bay, this new zone offers a heroic combat zone with a healthy dose of mystery. Adventurers should take note that Booty Bay is not associated with the current expansion content.

&#x200B;

PVP

Stranglethorn Vale has received several significant changes. 

* All characters on a realm have the option to participate in PvP. 
* Each character has the following abilities: 
   * Attack power
   * Cast animation
   * Dodge and Parry
   * Weapon damage
   * Healing and self-sustain

 

*This collection of nonsense was generated by one of the more advanced text 'generators' currently available. Trained on a huge number of web pages it will introduce ideas not found in the source material so the output is always somewhat novel (Fine-tuning material is every single X.X patch note ever, april fools patch notes, some fan-generated expansions and amazingly the entire news history from MMO-Champion.com).*

*I have a github* repo *that I can share that has all the training data, most of the generated data, and a shortlist from the insanity.*

2nd. Location; guilds would be able to choose a location anywhere in a zone as long as it isn‚Äôt blocked by the environment and doesn‚Äôt block off any buildings cities or NPCs. If you don‚Äôt like the location picked you can reposition it for 750k.

3rd. Visibility; they would be visible to all players on their realm regardless of guild affiliation.

4th. Utilities; your guild hall is able to have NPCs in it with various uses, in addition your guild hall will contain your Guild Bank and all members of your guild will be given a special Hearthstone to bring them to the hall.

5th. Architecture; you will be able to choose from different types of architectural styles for your guild hall depending on the zone it is located in.

6th.

191,How to Improve the Allied Races - Alliance,"Hey. Long-time lurker, first-time poster. Now, I've had my fair shares of disagreement with Blizzard's lore choices lately, but I've still really enjoyed the story and Allied Races that have been added to the game with BfA. That being said, I know there are many things that could be done to improve the Allied Races as they currently stand, without removing them or replacing them, as people suggested before. Blizzard would be much more likely to add to their current Allied Races rather than other changes to them, so I figured a thread discussing ideas for how to make them better could be nice. Something Blizzard may see and get some ideas from.

For example, for the Void Elves, they could add some new customization that resembles High Elves, ala Alleria. Same mechanics, however have them be the newly-recruited Void Elves who were/are being brought in by the original former Blood Elves the race is composed of. Could be a good way to bring more customization and visual styles to the really lacking diversity of the race, while also adding people's desperate desire for High Elves to the game, with somewhat of a basis in the current lore and game, from what we see with Alleria and around Stormwind.

I would put more ideas here, but I want to see what others have to say before. May edit this post to add them, may just put comments with them.",1571112226.0,"How to Improve the Allied Races - AllianceHey. Long-time lurker, first-time poster.

Ok, Classic might have increased the number of subscriptions but also drains the BFA-players. Therefore I think it's even worse now.

There may be a lot more competition now than there was back in 2009, indeed. Still there are other reasons why the players left. I hope people who read this will give examples of why they left WoW in the comments.

My main reason is that the game is not as balanced as it was once. PvP-only is not viable anymore and I can't play 20 minutes a-day. I can't match regular players because of their OP (broken) gear and it would take me hours to catch up with them. When I played MoP, BGs were more accessible and once I was done gearing up with that, I could try my chance in arena pretty fairly.

Why couldn't they have kept the world the same till Wrath of Lich King/Level 80 

THEN you do a super special kinda quest for your faction that once completed puts you in a ""Post Cataclysm Azeroth Zone"" not being able to travel back to pre CATA (or see Bonus)

OR  just a server switch. (where you kinda have two linked characters on two servers) 

Bonus:

Maybe when you'd reach a certain level post CATA you can find a some ""goblin/dwarf time machine"" and take you back to pre CATA (maybe with a really long cool down, like days so you cant keep switching.) and you would have your ""pre cata build/level"" so its basically linking two characters....

Everquest players even made fun of it. However, even Vanilla's 2-4 minute corpse runs are far more hardcore than what we have today.

For quite some time Blizzard has been littering their new maps with graveyards, which has now led to corpse runs of no more than 10-20 seconds on average. Sure this is very convenient, but currently dying in the world doesn't feel impactful at all and the result is there is no sense of danger in the world. World pvp feels like a joke when you know you can spend a minute trying to kill someone who attacked you, but even if you win they'll be back up within a few seconds before you can even catch your breath. It's pointless and removes any sense of danger.

In order to add that edge back to the world I feel like corpse runs should be designed to be at least two minutes on average.

Then comes Crash Lightning, the spell that enables the Shaman to do AoE damage reliably, but like 1/3 of the time it doesn't even proc on 2 or more people, you can literally have mobs side by side and use the spell and it still just procs on one enemy, it wastes so much of my time since I have to wait for the cooldown and I was missing so much DPS in dungeons and raids because the fucking spell won't proc

The last real issue I have is the PvP Talent ""Ride The Lightning"", it's also supposed to help with AoE by casting a Chain Lightning when you cast Stormstrike, but it straight up DOESN'T WORK, nothing else to it.

287,Balance Druid vs Elemental Shaman - 8.3,"Hi all!

First of all sorry about my bad english, is not my native language :D

I have been playing with a balance druid for almost all of the BfA raid tiers, and been actually topping the DPS meters (<98% parses). The problem is that I am a very weird person and I always find myself on the need of changing the character I play because I get 'bored'.

With this in mind, I was thinking about changing to an Elemental Shaman, because our raid is missing one ""decent"" shaman and I have never played with it at Mythic Mode.

The thing is that the most important part of the game for me, as a DPS player, is doing the mechanics propertly WHILE topping the DPS meters. For this reason, I want to play a class that I know I can 'compete' on logs with other people, and master it.

Now, I would like to hear what you have to say about those two different specs: Elemental Shaman vs Balance Druids.

I also want to know what you guys think will be better (eventhough we are now at the PTR phase). I honestly don't care about fun or which spec is easier, I just want to know which is performing better actually (I see them both equally as good) and some thoughts about this change. I want to commit to it, so changing my ""main"" to Elemental Shaman will be a decision I will keep on.

291,Frost mage 442ilvl low dps,"Hello guys,

&#x200B;

Maybe someone can help or provide an opinion.

&#x200B;

I have a 442 item level frost mage, that does a little to low dps on si single target (around 25-32k dps depending on the movement of the fight)

&#x200B;

I know the rotation and watched multiple videos + read all the guides i could found, but couldn't identify the issue.

i never cast Glacial Spike without a flurry proc on a single target, i watch and manage my cooldowns, use pots, flask, food.

I suspect is the gear, but my overall stats are pretty decent.

My 434 Assa rogue sims  32.5k dps and my mAGE 38.6K, which is insane with such a big item lvl discrepancy between them, 434 vs 442

I mention that in 8.2 i had an above decent dps with the same frost mage (compared with other dps in the raid group or M+ on the same item level spectrum)

Always potion/flask/food/fully enchants and all the good stuff + same player.

i never saw or read anything about frost being nerfed or had something happening to it, but it feels so low and frustrating now, with above average items.

&#x200B;

On AOE depending on the number of the present enemies i go to 60-100-120k dps, which seems good.

I'll post below a few links to my armory, r io, logs, if someone could look and give an opinion.

308,Why didn't I unlock the Highmountain Tauren,"So just now on a boosted character I finished grind for hours in Neltharion's Lair to get to exalted with the Highmountain Tauren, I finally finished my last run excited to make a Highmountain Tauren to use to play with my lower level friends, and it didn't unlock... I don't believe anywhere it said that I wouldn't earn rewards for using a boosted character, and the game still gave me the achievements for doing the story line and reaching exalted, but still nothing. I'm just really frustrated and disappointed because I can't buy a membership every month to keep playing and I just don't feel motivated to do that all again on my main character.

322,Is WoW the only video game that has done Druids good?,"Besides DnD, which of course isnt a video game, i cant think of any game that does Druids good.

Dragon Age Origin Druids (shapeshifters) were hot garbage. Changing shape took long spell casts, and you were incredibly limited in abilities when shapeshifted.

Druids in Divinity Original sin share nothing in common with what we would think of as druids. They are more Summoner/Elementalists. 

Baldurs gate is based on DnD Druids but lacks the sahpeshifting aspect (as far as i can tell. Never played).

Neverwinter Nights is, again, based on DnD druids, and has the Shapeshifting, and seems to be the only decent alternative to WoW druids at this time.

Really, what I wish is that the Elder Scrolls had a Druid style class. That would be the dream. Not turn based, so shape shifting wasnt a once or twice in combat thing. But constant shape shifting, like in wow, based on the situation.

324,Should gnome heritage goggles get the same treatment as the new goblin ones?,"As a gnome main from when I first started the game, I love the gnome heritage armor. The goggles up on the forehead is a great thing, but one of the main requests I've heard (and also felt like we needed myself) was the ability to put them down over your eyes like regular goggles too. As an RPer it feels weird switching to an entirely different pair of goggles to simulate this. But I figured special treatment like that wasn't super necessary.  


However, the goblin armor does \*exactly that\* with their new headpiece and goggles. I believe the way it's set up is that they're just two different head transmogs.

Only players who did well got enough points to get gear and those who did exceptionally well got gear faster.

So he grab the crowbar and goes to fight the next guy who is just starting with his fists and beats him into the ground without much effort.  Then he is given a chest plate to reduce the damage done and so on and so forth.  Basically giving him a snowball effect to the championship bout.  

The argument was as a normal player.  You never get to be rampage.  But fighter b who always gets bludgeoned to death by crowbars. Then you have to gather up enough earnings from losing to somehow gain an edge but sadly you will always be one step behind.

451,"What would the game be like if Alliance were the dominant faction in terms of things such as player population, raiding World Firsts, high-end PvP, being Blizzard's favorite faction, etc, like how Horde currently is right now?","Let's say that right now, the game is in a state where it turns out that the Alliance is the dominant faction of the game in pretty much all aspects. How would things in the game be like right now?

Here are some changes that I think the game would have:

-Instead of the Spirit racial that Humans had during the Classic days, I think, they would have a racial that allows them to deal more damage to Humanoid mobs, which would already be a big racial bias, given the amount of Humanoid mobs in the world.

-The Troll Beastslaying racial would be the % bonus XP from killing Beasts effect from the start in Classic, instead of the bonus damage against Beasts that it was originally.

-Will of the Forsaken would be in it's current state right now, so the meme about the Will of the Forsaken nerfs being a reason for people unsubscribing would not even be a thing.

-In The Burning Crusade, both factions get two new races. Alliance get High Elves and Draenei, while Horde get the lot less popular Broken, and another race. Maybe Lost Ones, but they seem too similar to Broken, and I can't really think of another fitting TBC race that they could get.

-In Wrath of the Lich King, people would notice even more about the Alliance bias of favoritism in story, i.e. the flashback quest about Arthas obtaining Frostmourne, and a raid encounter would have Muradin as an ally, and Horde would have no idea about who that guy is and how he is alive, since he was supposedly left for dead during that same scene in WC3.

-Sometime during the game, as a re-balancing change, as Orcs would probably be the most popular Horde race at the time, their Blood Fury racial would be changed from a healing received debuff to % increased damage taken, ala Death Wish or Recklessness, making that ability a liability in raiding since Blizzard conveniently put a lot of unavoidable AoE abilities as raid boss abilities. 

-The writing for Garrosh Hellscream would make him even more popular with the fan base as a whole, and his sudden Turn in the Siege of Orgrimmar days would frustrate the Horde fan base way more, leaving people wondering why Blizzard is deciding to kill off a favorite character, for a seemingly ""weak"" reason.

-The Goblin Rocket Jump racial would also get nerfed around the time of Legion and KJ's release, where a cast time (maybe 1.5 seconds) would be added, and a 1.5 second period where you would not be able to take any actions after the jump finishes.

-Instead of Teldrassil getting burned in BFA, the Alliance would successfully siege Thunder Bluff, leaving the Bluffs in ruins, and Baine would be killed off in a very baffling way, i.e. a stray rock or arrow hits him in the head and kills him.

-Nathanos would have been canonically killed off for good in Classic, in that quest where Alliance have to kill him.

Now I looked into it again because a friend started playing. I used to play mage, this time I wanted to try hunter. While the class mechanics are fun, I realized I was going to have a problem: Do I

1. enjoy the class I like more (hunter) and lose all my rep progress, forcing myself to do more of the obnoxious world quest rep grind?
2. play the class that I don't enjoy as much because it has more rep progress to get me allied races and flying
3. skip on rep and be forever stuck without allied races since you'll never get them?

And thus I quit again. Ceteris paribus I can't even come back, because now once you skip on an addon, you'll be behind forever (in terms of allied races/flying). It used to be that a new addon would mean everyone starts at almost the same point, but with this it isn't like that.

484,WoW Leveling can be made more interesting with local effects!,"Just an idea here - I see the discussion around how we could make WoW a more engaging experience, akin to how people  feel like Classic is like. I don't think it's the difficulty that's the defining factor, it's wether or not there is something the player can engage with. Letting normal mobs be a bit more of a challenge is fine, but I feel as though we can go further than that, now the game is so much older.

Which leads to this idea; what if all Zones (maybe apart from the starter Zones) had their own unique mechanic which the player needs to work with/around? And as you get to go to higher level zones, they become more intricate to reflect your higher skill-level. Examples:

* In the Duskwood, you gain a growing debuff called ""Enroaching Fear"" as you stay in the dark areas of the Zone. Enemies has a higher chance to Hit and Crit the larger this debuff is. However, if you stay around light-sources (like lamp-posts or a Basic Camp Fire) it goes away.
   * Potentially you could get a Quest that allows you to forge either a lantern that permanently caps the debuff so it isn't that big of a problem, or, say, a cloak that also gives *you* that buff the mobs get while in the shadows... Stick to the light or become one with the darkness?
* In Stranglethorn Vale, most Beast creatures have a chance of dropping a Trophy - Gorilla's Paw, Pristine Tiger Skin, Huge Crocolisk Fang - which can be sold to vendors around the Zone. Some may just give money for it, others may trade it for valuable profession items, some may take a lot of them to give a cool transmog and so on.
* In the Searing Gorge, a constant effect called ""Searing Heat"" is placed on you. It gives you less fire resistance but a small chance of dealing fire damage, as well as more damage when you use fire damage from spells. It can potentially be removed temporarily with any drink item that is considered cool (such as most beers, sodas, juices and so on).

How about that? This emphasizes what each Zone is about and gives this sort of ""meta-quest"" for every Zone; an effect you can deal with apart from simple questing. The examples I came up with are rather tame, but if you ask me they could easily be very dangerous or at least require attention to not be screwed over by.

491,"ilvl400, no mythic experience. How to get started?","Done all LFR raids and heroic dungs, but no idea how to get started on mythic 5mans. Yes, I figured I'd have to pug them but when I looked up the listings for dungeons, it's literally nothing else than ""+8"" ""+10"" ""+12"" ""+16"". This type of groups would definitely look me up to see I have no experience and not accept me, and idk if I want to go as burden anyway.

I suspect my best chance is to list myself and hope for the best, with some more realistic advertisement. What should I say and do to get a group that would beat the basic Mythic difficulty so I get started? I saw that some groups had set minimum ilvl - what's reasonable ilvl req to beating the basic M diff with randoms? Are some dungs more suitable for pleb groups if some dung has some easy to wipe bosses?

I'm in ok position as feral druid so I can try to fit in as tank, but I also imagine tank is the one role who should know about the differences between heroic and mythic more than others. Is the difference really mainly about everything having more hp/do more dmg or are there new abilities too?

Also what happens once that party completes? I heard you have to travel to the dungeon for mythic, but how does the group do it when people are from different servers? You just won't see the party members until you've all entered dung from the actual portal or something? But no portaling in or out at all?

I‚Äôve read there have been many nerfs to exp gains this method, and in my current experience I‚Äôve seen some people say that ‚Äúskip everything except final boss‚Äù just for the lump sum of exp at the end.

- Can we go back to Jewelcrafting having an option to add a socket? Lower ilvl item with socket being better that higher ilvl one witheout feels wrong/awful.

- Add option to upgrade gear like in WoD or how it is done with Benthic pieces, lets say 2 times x 5 ilvls (like Warforging works now), and when item is already warforged, we can't upgrade it.

- Do something with rings, I have to sim it everytime a ring drops for me.

- Make more trinkets customizable to some extent. Pocket-Sized Computation Device is decent idea that could be built upon.

- Add back legs enchant, might be from every profession tbh, not Enchanting exclusive. Also add back shoulder enchant even in form from Legion.

- Add chest/helm enchants but not dps ones. Def ones like stamina/armor/leech/etc. Helm could use/be minor stuff or some cool character effects one, like floating orb around, etc.

- Add back libram/totem/etc back, so every class have one. Might be empowering one of our spells/skills tiny bit.



As for professions: 

- Add more toys/pets/mounts asociated with them. 

- Add more quests connected with proffesion itself. Don't have to be epic ones, but having higher reciepie lvl from a decent quest would feel a lot better than waiting for rng WQ to show up.

- Let leveling a profession add experience like gathering ones does.

&#x200B;

[The Dragon Isles \(Rough map sketch\)](https://i.redd.it/pimzpv9m38s31.jpg)

**Introduction:**

Inspired heavily upon the principles of discovery and exploration, I wanted to create a concept for an expansion that focus heavily on **exploration, discovery,** and **mystery.** Part of the allure of *Mists of Pandaria* was that it broke up the over-the-top stakes of the previous expansion, *Cataclysm*. Much to that design philosophy of ‚Äúringing it in‚Äù, I wanted an expansion that took a break from the Old Gods, the Demons, and the Faction Conflict. 

**Story Overview**

Wrathion, the last son of Neltharion, has at last discovered the location of the Dragon Isles. The opposite side of Azeroth, beyond thousands of miles of open water from the nearest respite of land, lies the last bastion of exploration in the Great Seas of Azeroth. 

The Alliance and the Horde, having fought and died for decades, have finally ended their conflict. The Treaty of Orgrimmar has been signed, and the two factions now look to replenish their ranks and heal their wounds. 

Part of a new expeditionary force, Wrathion tasks heroes of the Horde and the Alliance to venture forth to the Dragon Isles, discover it‚Äôs secrets and find a way to heal Azeroth and restore the might of the Dragon Aspects.

Wrathion charges both factions with gaining the aid of the local peoples; the Alliance with garnering the support of the Scaleborne; The Horde has been tasked with seeking the aid of the mysterious and volatile Skjalir. 

Wrathion believes we can work out a truce between the two Factions within the Dragon Isles and convince them both to work towards our common goals. 

\-------

**NEW RACE (Horde):**

**Skjalir: Seekers of the Lost Queen**

&#x200B;

[\(Not my art\)](https://i.redd.it/nfnslp7048s31.jpg)

**Overview:**

Lived on a series of islands south of Northrend, near the Dragon Isles. Hunted the Protodragons from the Dragon Isles for sport. Joins the Horde, meets them after they discover their lands. Believes in **Blood and Glory.**

Believes the ultimate test of the heir to their Throne of Scales is to slay a Prime Protodragon, which is revered by their antagonistic counterparts, the Scaleborne. Rediscovered the Dragon Isles hundreds of years ago, and continues to search the Dragon Isles for the lost sword of their First Queen, Skjala of the Primal Blade.

**Design Inspiration:** 

Designed as the counterpart to the Alliance-aligned Scaleborne, these savage, though honorable, are directly related to the Vrykul of Northrend. However, these are primarily a Sea-Faring race, and have adjusted to the relatively warmer climate of the Dragon Isles and their new home, Vrykindh Isle. Their aesthetic appearance is inspired heavily on the **Visigoth** and **Celtic** tribes of the north which **warred with Ancient Rome**. They mark themselves with **blue warpaints**, which they believe give them magical protections and strength. They are a tall, lean, hulking race of Men with giant beards which they braid with bone ornaments made from the carcasses of their enemies. The center of their society is their King/Queen, who wins the title through glory of combat. They hold their Shamans and Priests in high regard, and their Priests are highly revered for their ability to peer into the future. 

**Storyline Ideas**

**Shadows Over Vrykhind**: Priests use Shadow/Void magic to peer into the Possible Future. They use special mystical herbs to help them traverse the infinite futures and find likely outcomes to battles, fortunes, and lovers. However, a dark cloud looms over the High Priestess, and many within the Circle of Sages begin to suspect the High Priestess‚Äôs alignment.

**The Legend of the Primal Blade:** The Seekers, warriors who devote their lives to finding the Primal Blade, and subsequently becoming the ruler of the Skjalir, have picked up some interesting leads that put them at odds with the current King. The King, fearing the warriors would be lost on a fools errand, dispatches the Champion to find out what leads they have found and where they will be heading. As the mystery unfolds, you discover that the First Queen may not be what she seems in the Legends. 

**Strangled Storms:** Venture through the treacherous and volatile Boiling Archipelago, and discover the whereabouts and schemes of the missing Sage, a shaman named Magnus. Magnus was the Sage of Flame, and disappeared shortly after the Sage of Storms was found dead in his lodge. Fearing the worst, King Bjarg has issued a bounty for Magnus, and it is up to you to discover the truth behind the death of the Sage of Storms. 

**Racials:**

**Savage Blow:** Empower your next damaging spell or ability within 5 seconds, increasing the effectiveness by 10%. 3 min CD.  

**Giant‚Äôs Stride:** Your base movement speed is increased by 8%. However, Snare effects against you are 8% more effective. 

**Scalebane:** Your attacks and spells penetrate 1% of your target‚Äôs defensives.

**Slayer‚Äôs Might:** Your Strength is increased by 1%.

**Dragonrider:** You are trained in riding, up to Expert Level (depending on Level). Your flight speed is increased by 5%.

**Ancient Seeker:** Your skill in Archaeology is increased by 5. You can also sometimes find artifacts within the world that can initiate Race-specific quests.

**Classes: Warrior, Shaman, Priest, Hunter, Mage, Rogue, Warlock, Death Knight**

**Vrykhind: Home of the skjalir**

**NEW RACE (Alliance):**

**Scaleborne: Keepers of the Isles**  

&#x200B;

[\(Not my art\)](https://i.redd.it/d8p32dn848s31.jpg)

More humanoid than Dragonkin, with armor and clothing inspired by ancient Greece and Rome. Scale patterns and design based on Protodragons (sharp beaks/jaws, reds and purples)

**Overview:**

Lives on a series of islands south of Northrend, near the Dragon Isles. Sworn protectors of the Protodragons. Worshippers of the Titans and their Dragon Flights. Joins the Alliance, meets them after they discover their lands. Believes in **Tradition, Wisdom, and Pacts**.

Descended from Protodragons, they regard them in high honor and spiritualism. They are sworn protectors of the Dragon Isles, which houses the secrets of the Titans, the **Librarium Protorium**. It is said to house the a device which could wipe out all life on Azeroth. They are sworn to protect the Dragon Isles from explorers, even from their own kin.

**Design Inspiration:**

Most of the design inspiration for the Scaleborne comes from Ancient Rome, Greece, and other Mediterranean cultures. These seafaring Dragonkin are descended from the Protodragons, and their blue and red scales sometimes seem to flicker with tempestuous energies. Their home is Crestus, a series of ancient islands off the coast of the Dragon Isles. Crestus is warm and temperate, with a Mediterranean climate and architecture based on the Ancient Greeks and Romans. The central hub of Crestus is Parthanos, which houses shrines to the Titans and is ran by two factions: The **Astral Order**: Powerful Mages and Priests who study the vast knowledge of the Keepers and try to divine the will of the Titans; but they also serve as the governing legislature for Crestus. The second faction is the **Protectorate**: Paladins and Warriors sworn to protect the citizens of Crestus and the secrets of the Dragon Isles. The Protectorate serve as the Legionnaires and the Security force for Crestus.

**Internal Conflict** (Quest Chain Ideas)

**Et tu Dracus?**: After a mysterious murder in the Astral Order, the Protectorate suspects foul play within the politically charged caste of Mages and Priests. However, something tells you that there may be more nefarious works at play here. A plucky apprentice within the Astral Order guides you through the complex web of political intrigue and lies to find the truth of the murdered Mage.

**The Marble Door:** Deciding to join an Academic ship bound for the shores, your ship is blown off course due to a storm. You decide to anchor on the nearby shores of the Crumbling Coast, and to take shelter within some nearby ruins. Dodging traps and navigating the maze, you discover exciting secrets to the creation and purpose of the Scaleborne, and awaken something that should have been left to slumber.

**Seeing Stars:** The Protectorate has a mage in custody who has been babbling incoherently and using his own blood to draw strange glyphs and symbols over the walls of the Dome of Lights, the huge observatory used by the Astral Order to peer into the heavens. The Protectorate Paladin accompanies you along your investigation into the madness of the mage, with hopes of curing the man of his madness.

**Racials:**

**Proto Breath:** Breath mystical fire in a cone, dealing X Frostfire damage to enemies and healing X health to allies. 3 min cooldown.

**Protoscales:** When you take melee damage, you sometimes accumulate Charges. At 10 Charges, you can Discharge on a targeted enemy, dealing X Nature Damage. 1 Min cooldown.  

**Phalanx:** Reduces physical damage taken by 1% and increased your Block effectiveness by 5%.

**Astral Attunement:** Your spells and abilities consume 1% less Mana and your Arcane magic effects are 1% more effective.  

**Ancient Keeper:** Your skill in Archaeology is increased by 5. You can also sometimes find artifacts within the world that can initiate Race-specific quests. 

**Classes: Warrior, Paladin, Priest, Hunter, Mage, Monk, Rogue**

I killed him and got a level 110 blue ""Dread Vulture Waistcord"" first try (Item level 210).

After reading up a bit, I realised I may have screwed up.  It says he has a 1.8% chance of dropping this item, but is that correct? I'm hearing things like it's a one-off item, and I'll never get it again.

1) Can I ever get this item again but at level 120?

2) If I don't, will it permanently harm me? (is there way better gear later/should this just be cosmetic?)

3) Should I only farm the rest of these rares(?) at level 120?

571,Spiraling from an xpac theory.,"So I sat here for the last few hours researching old gods after I watched a Bellulargaming video on leaks datamined from 8.3 and beyond, so ... spoiler warning first in case I get any of this right.

It started after Bellular mentioned something, in the cinematic with Tirion crowning Bolvar as the new Lich King. Bellular mentioned this as there seems to be a heap more new VO's from Bolvar coming our way, but Bellular found something interesting in rewatching this cinematic, the music it was playing in the background. It was a theme that's played before, and it's the theme for Y'saarj. Maybe Blizz were simply reusing this song as it sounded cool, but ... what if they weren't? So began my spiral into madness.

One of the very first things I thought of, was why. Why of all places is N'zoth going to attack the Vale? Well it's simple, there's an old titan facility underneath, but there's one issue, Garrosh already beat them there, and took it's treasure to Orgrimmar. We went there during the Siege of Orgimmar, the Underhold, deep underneath Rage Fire Chasm. There, he strung up the heart of an old god, which later was revealed as the Heart of Y'saarj. Y'saarj, funnily enough, is responsible for the Sha. Garrosh threw the heart into the pools in the Vale which caused the massive Sha corruption in the area, which is now being fixed in 8.3.

""Ok, cool"" I thought to myself, ""we're getting more Old God lore in WoW"". Problem is, I started comparing events in 8.3 to the Y'saarj story and lore, and with the coming extra VO's from Bolvar, I spiraled further, since the LK's throne is also the only place known to freely walk between Azeroth and the Shadowlands.

One thing has been annoying me though throughout BFA. What have we actually done to heal Azeroth. The heart chamber is looking pretty nice these days but there's one issue I still have. THE GIANT SWORD STICKING OUT OF THE PLANET. We sapped the energy from it at the end of Legion, cool, but it's still there, still causing havoc, but why did Sargeras decide to have a crack like that. Keeping in mind, it was Aman'thul, a Titan on the Pantheon, that tore Y'saarj from Azeroth and tossed him into the Great Dark Beyond. Which essentially Blizzards WoW name for space, not some other dimension. 

Ok i'm spiraling again, i'll try and keep it on topic. I jumped into the game, and portalled to the Sword. Jumped on my flying mount and had a real good look. I did some research on Gorribal, the name of Sargeras' sword, problem is, in canon, the sword was never given a name. Which is probably for good reason, because as I look at the sword I notice something interesting. The sword looks nothing like it does in previous images of it, instead, bones twist and writhe on the surface, it has an extremely long ""blade"" made from bone, the hilt too is made of bone and in the center of the hand guard, where we sapped the swords power, is a perfect circular indent, with layers of bones pointing inwards, I was like ""that's weird, that looks like an eye socket"".

BOOM! Spiraling intensifies, I looked more into the lore of Y'saarj, trying to tie events of 8.3 into my current theory. Garrosh, brought the heart of Y'saarj to Orgrimmar, there he sapped all of it's power and we fought him, and won. With his corrupted Gorehowl ""Xal'atoh"" sticking out of the ground. If anyone used that axe in MOP, even now, you can sometimes hear whispers coming from it, it's not a Sha voice, but if it was why would it's voice lines include ""Eyes are a window to the soul, shatter them forever"", ""When you walk among the Black Forrest (yes this was capitalised), you WILL see"", ""With each thread ... Unraveled, a step closer to my realm"", and ""You will rest in Ny'alotha"".

Daaaaang son the plot thickens! Well, that's what I thought I said but I smashed out an energy drink (big mistake) and kept digging.

So, of course the first place N'zoth attacks is the Vale, but I don't actually know if the Heart has remained under Orgrimmar, dormant, or it was moved back to the vaults for safe keeping. If it has, N'zoth is clearly after it.

But why, I'm guessing our trip to Ny'alotha in 8.3 is going to give us a lot more information, but my guess is N'zoth is looking to resurrect the Black Empire, no big surprise there, but Y'saarj has been thought dead for the longest time. Heeeere's where my theory really started taking root. But it all hinges on information currently not available to us, so most of this is going to be assumptions, but bare with me here.

1. We don't know what's on the other side of Azeroth
2. Y'saarj was massive, Aman'thul was the same size of Sargeras when he pulled that squiddy boi off the planet.
3. An act like that would have left a deep scar.
4. Does Sargeras' sword stop at the heart, or is it hanging out the other side? 
5. Why is N'zoth going after a dead old god?

These are my main questions, I have like, a million more but we'll stick with these.

I'm guessing ... BUT.

Sargeras' sword in WoW canon is not his sword from when it was shattered in a duel on the pantheon.

It is the dead skeleton of Y'saarj.

Right now it is leeching the power of Azeroth, for currently an unknown purpose, well, unknown except for the fact that N'zoth is currently after Y'saarj's still beating heart. Fits thematically with the heart chamber don't you think?

Bolvar currently has the closest relationship to the void out of anyone, a relationship with the shadowlands, I wouldn't think this would have been used as an easy in story wise for blizz, except for the fact that next xpac, we're seeing a lot more races added to the Death Knight roster. Bolvar is finally on the move, and he is not the same fresh hotness we left him in. Any DK who's done the order hall campaign can attest to that. The LK's original mission was to create the scourge to fight against the burning legion. What if the LK, with the burning legion defeated, has set his sights on a more imminent threat, one that Sylvanas has also seen coming in her death (see the books, throws herself off ICC after the death of the LK but is saved by the valkyr, after seeing the state Arthas was in, which wasn't good). 

Essentially, I believe the LK is making moves again. Creating new DK's to bolster his army for the looming threat, not from the shadowlands, but from Azeroth, and more importantly, from space. 

I know there have been lots of ""leaks"" from 4chonk but from what I can see from 8.3, most of it was bull, we already have mechagnomes in 8.3, which makes be believe the tinkerer class is not a thing, we're getting something completely different. IF we are going to the Shadowlands, then ... Why? We still have the sword to contend with, are we just going to leave it there? What would we have accomplished in the next content patch that would have us believe Azeroth is safe enough to leave?

No, we are not going to the Shadowlands, not at first, I believe the Shadowlands are going to be more like Argus in Legion. It's definitely somewhere we have to go to face the Void, but that's not the threat right now.

Y'saarj is coming, N'zoth is going to see to it, and we will have to face the Black Empire in it's physical grandeur ... right before Wrathion hit's the Reorigination Array and kills us all. Sending us to the Shadowlands, using the tonic to make sure we don't succumb to the whispers and any research completed by Magni and Mother in 8.3, where we chase the old gods down once and for all.

N'zoth's Hearthstone card ability ""Summon all ""Deathrattle"" minions that died this game"".

Also, I might be going crazy here but, after my trip to Silithus before my spiral into a sugar crazed frenzy, I noticed a little something, could be nothing, but ...

Is the star left by the Pantheon getting brighter?

Death Knight - Undead because of course

Hunter - Blood Elves, because of Warcraft 2 archers and ranger lore

Shaman - Orcs, because of Warcraft 3

Demon Hunter - Night Elves, because Illidan

Monk - Pandaren!

Druid - Night Elves, because of the nature vibes

Priest - Draenei, because of the light, but also shadow

591,Thank you to devs for new Auction House! List of some of the changes (that I love).,"Auction House was a very old system that saw basically no ""backend"" changes for 15 years.

It was literally unusable on my large server for few months when BfA launched and the goblin spirit in me suffered, now I can't wait to use auction house after the changes!

Some of the changes:

1. Muuuuuch faster AH thanks to a complete reboot. That is HUGE especially for people who flip transmog and have to scan hundreds of items.
2. Automating sorting from cheapest, no pages and no ""stack sizes"".
3. Easy buy of certain amount - pick any amount and you will buy that much with 2 or 3 clicks...
4. ...or choose a price and buy all auctions cheaper than that price!
5. Easy sell  - you can see other auctions of that item when you post and you don't have to without caring about stack sizes.
6. Less undercutting - latest auction is bought first AND no copper included in AH.
7. No bids for stackable items and bids aren't necessary for all other auctions - few people use them anyway.
8. ""Uncollected only"" and ""upgrade only"" filters - huge improvement for collectors and BoE buyers.
9. Stacks of the same item now go into one mail. It doesn't seem like much but if you buy a lot it saves you time on waiting for the mailbox to refresh.
10. You can check your auctions and easily see if they are undercut.
11. Whole new ""favorite items"" system that lets you chose items you regularly buy, and buy them in few clicks.
12. And probably a whole bunch more that I don't remember. Once again the speed of the AH is a godsent for all big servers where AH had trouble even functioning properly.

All in all I am super excited and can't wait for it to be implemented. Wanted to share my hype of the change that was long over due and finally will happen!

Edit: Another small thing - posting price of stackable items will be brought back to the same price it was before tge bandaid fix. It's important mostly for people who sell old world materials from what I know.

Edit 2: All prices shown are now price per item, which is great and combined with the other changes will make addons like auctioneer much less needed, TSM will no longer be needed for part of the people who used it. I am actually curious about fate of TSM, because from what I know, I will have to be redone almost from scratch to work with the new AH.",1570949872.0,"Thank you to devs for new Auction House!

Like seriusly,i was having fun in nazjatar doing WQ and varius other things before these were added. If you want to add a challenge for hardcore mythic raiders add it to fucking raids/dungeons, im sure they will appreciate the challenge.

Is there some kind of stat change that I'm not aware of that Blizzard for some reason magically and exclusively chose to nerf my entire account because it was just so awesome that they needed to help other players keep up with mine?

Secondly, I noticed quite a few changes. The chat system for instance, I asked in General chat why it won't let me use general chat outside of cities and I guess apparently after I logged off in order to use my Boosted Character thing on a realm that I felt like using it on, I was allowed to talk in General chat outside of cities so I guess the chat must have broke or something while I was on my other character before the boosted one. I guess Blizzard has been tinkering around with the chat system lately, so my question is asking what exactly are they doing with it?

Third; I noticed a huge change in Professions, they've separated the profession skills sub-categories a little differently from before. I like it, but it's a tad confusing -- for example Classic/ Vanilla content profession skill 1-300, has a 1-75 cap, once it reaches 50/75 does it automatically expand to 150 cap or do I still need to go to specific trainers to increase them?

Last thing that was immediately weird to me. Is that I was not aware that leaving the capital city of Orgrimmar that wild mobs would be classic level capped at between level 58-61 in the world in general. I like this, however, I also hate it. I wondered if after the experience I had playing Legion whether or not they would apply the same leveling system to the overall world at some point, but it's just weird as hell seeing what used to be a bunch of level 10-12 boars & raptors outside of Orgrimmar all magically level 58-61.

761,"Weapon diversity makes or breaks class Identity, and the designers have work to do","Classic wow is charming, ancient in design and flawed. But playing as a Warrior or Enhancement Shaman on there made me realize that I miss something from that era in the modern game:

Customization in Weapon choice.

Modern Survival Hunters are designed to be a savage Predator/Trapper in the wilds that uses melee attacks, yet they cannot use any one-handed melee Weapons. Fury Warriors have Titan's Grip, yet cannot just slice opponents down quickly with fast one-handers. Shamans used to be able to wield mighty two handers and enjoy the RNG of large windfury crits and a cost.
I wish Blizzard would realize that for many specs, the option of using one or two-handers should be there, even if it takes some additional design space.
Furthermore, having seperate loot tables for one handed agility and strength items just makes little to no sense flavor wise and makes transmog farming in current content rather aggravating with personal loot.
I hope they will look into this and finally give hunters the Rexxar fantasy we all deserve while still allowing us to wield mighty lances if we so desire.
It comes at a cost of additional design ressources, but I feel it would be worth it. A lot of modern skills use aggregate dmg numbers for a lot of their skills anyway, and if 1h/2h have normalized stats, they can solve the titans grip/single minded fury problem too. or even better: give us the option of using a 2h in our main and a 1h in our off-weapon as well (much more realistic anyway).
If they implement that correctly, it could make for meaningful choices if weapon speeds actually affect gameplay and make you consider a different talent build, what weapons with procs to use and the like.

Newly installed client. Deleted the wtf folder.

I'm in Stormwind in channels 1 / 2 and 3 (general / trade and local defense)
I am able to read all 3 channels. I am able to write in trade. BUT if I try to write in channel 1 or 3 the client tells me I'm not in the channel.
This is only in Stormwind. In Ironforge or Darnassus all 3 channels work perfectly fine. Any ideas?

894,Increasing the importance of reputation with Alliance/Horde factions.,"Does anybody else feel like the faction reputation with playable races is underused? IMO, people should start with a certain reputation level based on your race towards both alliance and horde races. These reputations would reflect races and factions' relationships with each other and would make it easier for some races to become more ""neutral ones"".

&#x200B;

Example: As a goblin, you start at friendly with horde races and neutral with every alliance race except Gnomeregan, which is mutually hated with the Bilgewater cartel. Justified by goblins being overall more neutral and would want to pursue as many trade opportunities as possible.

Night elf faction would still be hostile towards most horde factions, maybe except for Nightborne/Silvermoon. Now Silvermoon could become more neutral race - officially stil with the Horde, but a Belf character would start at friendly with most Alliance factions. The same could go for the Forsaken, now with the change in leadership.

919,Sylvanas and Delaryn in retrospect (sort of 8.3 spoilers),"In light of everything that has happened in 8.2/will be happening in 8.3, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on a point of significant story controversy back at the beginning of the expansion. 

Sylvanas‚Äô motivations have been discussed at length. Particularly, a veritable firestorm arose over the rationale behind her decision to burn Teldrassil. However, I think we can now safely say that it was Sylvanas‚Äô intent to do so from the very beginning of her campaign into Elven territory.

When it happened, we all talked at length about how bafflingly immature and irresponsible her actions were. Had she really committed genocide at the behest of a single, fallen, goading night elf archer? Sylvanas had been impetuous before, but this seemed to be a bridge too far for many people. Her decision was repeatedly described as entirely morally bankrupt (true) and without any strategic justification.

However, now we know for a fact what many theorists suspected from the beginning. Whoever Sylvanas‚Äô master is, she has been serving them for some time ‚Äî since the War of Thorns for certain, and arguably since the first battle of the Broken Shore. She‚Äôs on the record now saying that massive, widespread loss of life is not a consequence of her ambitions, but a condition of them. She wanted to do something heinous enough to start the fourth war ‚Äî so she went to the most militant faction of the Alliance and gave them an entirely justifiable reason to declare all-our war against ‚Äúher‚Äù Horde.

Also wrapped up in this is the nature of risen Delaryn and the other undead night elves. Their sudden willingness to serve seems entirely nonsensical ‚Äî until you consider that they do not serve the *Horde* but Sylvanas (and by extension, Sylvanas‚Äô master). What did they see? What do they know that we don‚Äôt? Blizzard has said that Delaryn‚Äôs will is her own, a statement that drew a lot of ire and skepticism. However, it seems now to be entirely true. Delaryn‚Äôs cadre are not being controlled; I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs far more likely that they simply caught a glimpse of whatever is driving Sylvanas, and it drove them somewhat mad as a result.

I‚Äôm not saying this is great writing and all of Blizzard‚Äôs storytelling mistakes are instantly redeemed. But I am curious as to how the community views this particular through-line in retrospect, knowing what we know now.",1570842971.0,"Sylvanas and Delaryn in retrospect (sort of 8.3 spoilers)In light of everything that has happened in 8.2/will be happening in 8.3, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on a point of significant story controversy back at the beginning of the expansion.

928,21 days to Blizzcon - are you excited?,"Hello!

So it's only 21 days until Blizzcon this year and as we all know, new expansion is going to be probably revealed. Even though this month is not the best for Blizzard due to all the controversy - I'm still really excited to hear new announcements especially when it comes to WoW, Diablo and Warcraft 3 (hopefully we will get a release date).

What I would love to see when it comes to a new expansion:

1. Player housing - a proper, optional system with tons of customization (way better than terrible Garrisons). I play since TBC and with every expansion I'm waiting for player housing. It could be a great secondary progression system, something compared to the existing collections system. We could collect tons of furniture and new houses etc. I think it would be great.
2. I also hope new expansion will be a little bit ""darker"" than BFA. I really loved the theme of TBC and WotLK and I hope we will get something similar next.

1002,Why can't we just have access to the new allied races like all other races??,"As a person who just played Horde most of my WoW life (ever since late Vanilla) grinding the new allied races SUCKS.

This would be a great opportunity to enjoy the Alliance side for once with the new race that looks almost like my favorite one."" NOPE!

Unless I have grinded the rep I cant make void elf. I also don't have an Alliance max level character. So if I want to play the new allied races, I will have to either make a brand new character and level to max, then grind the rep OR make a dk and level to max which can make it a but easier OR make a DH and level to max (I find DH kinda boring as a class tho) OR pay for a 110 boost and then still grind 10 more levels for max level then grind rep. (Or I could just stay at 110 and grind only Void elf rep in my case but for the newer ones i'd still have to level)

So yeah as a super casual player who usually has about 1 or maybe a lucky 2 hours max to play everyday excluding weekends where I may or may not have the chance to play for around 3 - 4 hours, I can only spend most of my time doing the usual grinds. Daily heroic/mythic runs plus world quest usually eats up the one hour I have on weekdays and raids usually eat up the time I have on weekends. I can't really afford to level a new character right now unless I just completely abandon my main and make that my new main for a while.

&#x200B;

I was curious if it is possible to unlock allied races cross faction. For example, my main is a Horde and is nearly Exalted with Argussian Reach. As long as I get Exalted with them on my horde, am I able to jump onto one of my level 110 Alliance characters to complete the recruitment quest or does the character who is exalted need to be the one to do it (meaning I would need to grind rep on an alliance)?

Thanks for any and all support!",1

I'm generally a nice person fully willing to help others in whatever they may need, but for the love of all that is holy if you pull before a tank I will not hesitate to kick you. It is just incredibly annoying and pointless, especially when the healers try to heal you because you take more damage than the tank. I'm not getting mad, just hoping that people will see this and stop this pointless pulling.

Just throwing this out there, and I'm sure many of you can agree with me when I say that it's very stupid behavior.",1570807724.0,"Pulling before a tank.Dear everyone who pulls before the tank.

One of the early steps is the As I Walk through the shadow of the Moon -> Foothold quest you pick up at the ship north of your Garrison. As I follow Prophet Velen to the Lunarfall Ruins he evaporates at the Garrison (Lunarfall) gates and can't be found.

1030,New Il'gynoth Whispers,"Our buddy from the Emerald Nightmare is back in 8.3 with some new riddles for us! I'm gonna analyze them a bit and I want everyone to contribute their theories and thoughts.

>Before the last shadow falls, the Father of Sleep shall savor his feast.

The ""Father of Sleep"" may have something to do with the Emerald Dream. It could be referring to Malfurion or Cenarius. What the last shadow is and what the feast is I have no idea.



>The golden one claims a vacant throne. The crown of light will bring only darkness.

Almost definitely referring to Calia taking the throne of Lordaeron in Sylvanas' absence. I'm taking a shot in the dark here but maybe the ""crown of light"" bringing darkness may be the idea that many Forsaken will reject her and start a civil war.

It's far far less likely but the Golden One could also possibly be Turalyon taking the throne in Anduin's absence for whatever reason. 

>When their mistress beckons, nine ravens take flight. Each seeks a prize to earn her favor.

The mistress could be Sylvanas. The ""ravens"" could be Nathanos and eight other Dark Rangers.

But ""the Uncrowned"" are also associated with ravens. Perhaps a female member of the Uncrowned is trying to manipulate the world from the shadows once again now that the Legion business is taken care of.

>The vassal of life disguises treachery. Beware the eyes of green.

The vassal of life could be Alexstrasza. At the end of the 4.3 Legendary questline we see that she sent a red dragon to kill Wrathion and Wrathion says he hopes we see the truth about them now. Perhaps she is not wholly benevolent.

>Five lanterns, now darkened. The flame they seek will light the masters' way.

No idea what the laterns or flames are. But the ""masters"" may be the other Old Gods. They're still hanging out in the earth.

Il'gynoth has mentioned Five Torches and Five Keys in the Emerald Nightmare though. Perhaps he's still referring to the same thing?

>The blind queen wields a scepter of bone. From the deep she calls forth doom.

There's a lot of people this could be. It could be Sylvanas with her bow being the ""scepter of bone"". I believe we should keep our eyes peeled for any female characters holding something that could be interpreted as a bone though.

The blindness of the queen is probably metaphorical. Perhaps whoever it is referring to is blind to the true cost of their actions. Maybe like Tyrande who might be on the track towards doing something stupid.

>The cunning ones kneel before six masters, but serve only one.

Six masters to me sounds like the Kirin Tor Council of Six. Perhaps there's some Kirin Tor mages who aren't who they say they are? Or maybe the Council of Six is being manipulated by a single entity?",1570803207.0,"New Il'gynoth WhispersOur buddy from the Emerald Nightmare is back in 8.3 with some new riddles for us!

I‚Äôm not going to pretend I know everything or anything, I‚Äôm just piecing together some dots.

Awhile back we all revived a fun leak for 8.3 and the next expansion. I still believe it holds up, so bare with me. The leak is 8.3.5 is the conflict over Azeroth, we shift our focus to n‚Äôzoth, or visa versa. A very calculated game of chess by sylvanas. How do we kill a god? Sylvanas has a dagger to seal a god does she not? Now having n‚Äôzoth sealed away she now has a powerful weapon and sets siege on storm wind. 8.3.5 is going to set up the shadow lands, and much like it was said on that leak we have everyone finally meet up towards the end, however somewhere in the mid where they start to get into the final conflict. The lich king shows up, not knowing or the alliances already forged. I‚Äôm going to back my confidence in this theory with the most recent data mine from the ptr, showcasing all new allied races have all been given death knight models. Here‚Äôs the twist that was left out  in the leak. Goblins, and gnomes  maybe able to create a device That can get the players of Azeroth to the plane of the shadowlands. Azeroth still needs hero‚Äôs and this is the best point to cause a new raise in death knights, the mass loss of life in storm wind. If we all die at the end of the battle for Azeroth, some would come back to serve. Ny‚Äôalotha being in the center of the shadowlands is also very possible. Like it was said in the video the other day. Ny‚Äôalotha is everywhere, it‚Äôs all around you. The same could be said for the shadowlands, emerald dream and then some. Perhaps ny‚Äôalotha being inside of the shadowlands like that makes me feel like they are trying to fuse planes of existences on top of themselves.

1038,"Even with increased iLvl, it's a very disappointing legendary","The new legendary cloak got a new name and ilvl boost on the PTR. It starts at 445 ilvl (normal ilvl for next tier of raiding), increasing by 10 ilvl every 5 ranks, capping at 475 ilvl at Rank 15 (mythic ilvl for next tier).

The thing is, while the ilvl is nice, it doesn't have many secondary stats for a legendary. Honestly, my currently equipped 445 with a socket has more secondary stats than this legendary cloak, and if M+10 drops 460 ilvl, a socketed cloak from a +10 will be better than this cape for many if not all classes.

I know that this legendary has a Sanity effect that will probably be needed for some content, but unless you need this cloak for every boss in the new raid, many people won't use. I think that no boss from the new raid drops cloaks (it makes sense), but what will they do with dungeon loot?

1090,Account Banned. Tried contacting Blizzard,"I have been permanently banned from WoW and after sending an appeal and trying to contact Blizzard I got looped back to the appeal.I have been playing both retail and classic. I've mostly been raid-logging, taking care of my alts and doing the odd key here and there on retail. As for classic I was farming Zul'Farrak, sending the cloth to a bank toon and having a friend reset the dungeon. The bank toon used the addon AuctionFaster to sell the cloth. The only thing I've installed on my computer recently is DebugDiag to help me look into my blue screen errors I've been having recently. One of which had me relocate all my Blizzard games.

Yesterday I turn on my computer and go AFK, come back about 5 hours later to prep for raid and see that my account was banned. I checked my emails and see that I was banned for ""Exploitative Activity: Unauthorized Cheat Programs (Hacks) "" which surprised me.

edit: I didn't go AFK on WoW for 5 hours, I just opened [battle.net](https://battle.net) and left for a while

I sent an appeal and while I was waiting, I started watching raid from the sidelines and looking for people who had similar issues to me. I tried both web chat and getting a callback, both said that the purpose of those channels weren't for what I needed and redirected me to the appeal service. The ticket response said that they reviewed the penalty and the determined it was accurate.

Does anyone know if I there's a way to have this actually looked into? Sucks a lot losing something which I spent a lot of hours on when I really don't think I've done anything wrong.

update: I made another ticket because I needed to remove my authenticator after doing a system restore. No issues with this, that problem got resolved immediately.  
I mentioned my WoW account being banned but they ignored it in the ticket.   
In a previous ticket that I reopened, they pointed me to the Blizzard appeal page.   
In the appeal that I reopened, they said: "" After a look for you I'm afraid that we'll not be able to overturn this penalty. However, I believe that you're a legit player, and things on this account are not fully exploitative. I've managed your penalty from permanently banned to a 6-month suspension. Please kindly wait for 6 months for the suspension to be over.""  
I still feel like I haven't had any real contact with Blizzard and that I'm getting automated responses.

1112,8.3 Ending Theories and Blizzcon 2019,"So with 8.3 being announced and we pretty much know everything about it except the ending how can they reveal the next expansion without us actually knowing the ending and potentially in turn give it away? They did the same thing when annoucing BFA in 2017 with argus and antorus the burning throne not having been released, which is a huge deal because we needed to know if we stopped Sargeras or not. then all of the sudden a trailer drops for a battle between horde and alliance and fans can conclude that legion was defeated again in some capacity with the shocker being that Sargeras plunged his sword into azeroth. If the trailer for the next expansion is released at Blizzcon this November it could essentially tell us what happens in our encounter with N'Zoth before it actually happens. This could confirm a lot of opinions that Blizz doesn't care about storytelling and just wants to continue catering to end-game players just trying to get the best gear, which I thought is what they are trying to get away from. OR they release the trailer and it makes no sense because again we don't know what happens yet even with most of the dialogue being datamined and we just have to continue theorizing. A third option is they don't release anything remotely like a new expansion reveal and fans are pissed off. Seems like a losing battle for Blizz but that's their fault.

One thing that came to mind is at the end of WoD we defeat Archimonde and Kadghar says this isn't the last we've seen of the legion and then the next expansion is legion. but in this instance we had already finished Hellfire Citadel and then the next expansion was announced which makes perfect sense. so i guess one of my questions is why are they doing their reveals in reverse order?

Now onto the most important part of this thread I would honestly like to hear some people's theories about how this expansion is going to end. 2 weeks ago it seemed like BFA was over and a good chunk of the story would carry over to the next expansion. upon hearing news of 8.3 it seems like it's going to be wrapped up too quickly. For me the questions still on the table are,

1. Is N'Zoth actually the big bad capable of Azeroth's demise or is it Sylvanas and Death or a third option that has yet to be revealed?
2. Is Sylvanas's grand scheme still a bit of a mystery or has it really been completely revealed and it just doesn't seem that impressive......yet?
3. Is the Shadowlands tease still very much in play? (with the war being over it doesn't seem likely that all the major characters are going to die like it described in the leak)

Honestly aside from the game mechanics which I'm not a huge fan of i just really care about the story and trying to make sense of it all so some help answering these questions and just hearing other people's thoughts on the future of the game would be very welcomed here.

1146,[8.3 Spoilers] Looking back on the Emerald Nightmare Il'gynoth whispers,"So, we now have a new batch of il'gynoth whispers from the 8.3 ptr. I wanted to look back at the old ones with the new knowledge we have gained over the course of BFA, and see if we can definitively pin down what each one was referring to.

First, lets get the most obvious ones out of the way:

**To find him, drown yourself in the circle of stars.** - This one is simply about the location of N'zoth's prison. Given that the last area of the eternal palace is called ""circle of stars"", I think we can safely cross this one off the list.

**The king of diamonds has been made a pawn.** - I think the events of the eternal palace nail this one down definitively as well. We worked with magni (crystal-y diamond boi) to empower the heart of azeroth, unwittingly providing the key to N'zoth's freedom.

Next, theres a few that are a little less certain, but still might be demystified given what we know so far:

**Her heart is a crater, and we have filled it.** - This is probably referring to the heart of azeroth, given that we, acting in accordance with N'zoth's plan, ""filled"" it with AP. Could also be referring to the world soul, not entirely sure here.

**The lord of ravens will turn the key.** - It's by no means certain, but in retrospect im pretty sure this one is referring to sylvanas, since her bargain with Azshara ended up providing the key to freeing N'zoth. Also ravens are death symbols, and sylvanas has been going on about 'Death' with a capital D an awful lot lately. This one's still open though in my opinion.

**Its surface blazes bright, masking shadows below.** - This one could also be referring to either the heart of azeroth (its bright and shiny, but was ultimately a key instrument in N'zoths plan). Also could refer to a potentially corrupted titan world soul, but it could be something else entirely. My personal hot take: there's old gods in the sun.

The last group are those that, in my opinion, are still COMPLETELY up in the air. Even with all we've learned since EN, I have no clue what these are talking about:

**The boy king serves at the master's table. Three lies will he offer you.** - I don't think we've seen any hints as to what these 'three lies' are yet. The obvious 'boy king' is anduin, but other than that I'm completely clueless on this one. It seems to indicate that he's somehow helping N'zoth ('the master') but I don't think we've seen any signs of that.

**At the hour of her 3rd death, she will usher in our coming.** - Given that N'zoth's coming is already pretty ushered in from the looks of things, I have zero idea what this 'third death' was supposed to be. The only character that 'died' was Azshara, but that was her first as far as I know. If anyone has any ideas, feel free to share.

**From the earth, he draws strength. Our earth. Our strength.** - At first, I thought this might end up referring to thrall, but he hasn't been shown to use any sort of shamanistic powers for some time now. Maybe Wrathion, since the black dragonflight is associated with earth? This one is still entirely open, or at least it seems that way to me.

And last but certainly not least,
**Five keys to open our way. Five torches to light our path.** - This one, out of all of them, is by far the most perplexing. I don't even have the slightest clue where to begin, and ever since EN this one has been the subject of completely bonkers speculation, none of which shows any sign of being right (world trees, pillars of creation, etc). We see these 'torches' referenced again in the new whispers, so whatever this refers to is probably yet to happen.

So that's my take given what we know so far. I'm by no means an expert, so if there's any likely leads or events I missed, feel free to share.",1570763514.0,"[8.3 Spoilers] Looking back on the Emerald Nightmare Il'gynoth whispersSo, we now have a new batch of il'gynoth whispers from the 8.3 ptr.

In my opinion, Drustvar and the Drust would have been a more fitting setting for Sylvanas to pursue her death aspect dealings. Gorak Tul's whole point was to avoid death and return from Thros, a realm of death. The Drust obviously had methods of doing this. 

It seemed the more obvious route for Sylvanas to pursue her means of preservation with the only death themed zone (besides Bwomsamdi, who is clearly against Sylvanas). The Drust allying with Sylvanas (or even the Horde in general) would have made more sense as it was the Humans that invaded their Homeland and ultimately defeated them. 

It gets dicey with Jaina's story involving Gorak Tul, but in terms of Sylvanas's Story, this seemed the better option. Azshara and N'Zoth were always going to be freed, they didn't explain any of Sylvanas's involvement, she could have simply been left out completely and the events would have still happened, albeit the factions would have been sent to Nazjatar for another easily explainable reason.

This is all hypothetical since we have no idea where 9.0 is leading. It just seems like a wasted chance to broaden and make better connections to Sylvanas potentially allying with Death.

1230,I'm a new player and I have no clue how to move on from where I am now.,"Hey guys, I'm a new player who just hit 120 on his warrior. Leveling was pretty okay and straight forward so I always had an idea of how to progress.
Now that I hit 120 I'm completely overwhelmed with all the things I can do now. I watched a few guides that said I should get Pathfinder, do the War Campaign (which I already completed) and start to gear up, which is the point I struggle the most with.

I really want to raid. Raids are what got me into WoW in the first place. It looked so cool seeing all these people working together to finally get that boss they've been working on the last couple of days/weeks and I want to experience that too.

Now here's my problem: I don't know how to get there. I want to tank (which eventually isn't the best choice for a new player, I know) and I went for a couple of heroic dungeons now and they weren't too hard. The loot I got from there was around ilvl 375+ if I remember correctly and as I felt comfortable tanking in heroic dungeons I thought: ""let's give LFR a shot. How bad can it be and the loot is also much better than dungeon loot.""

It was a mess. I didnt know any of the boss abilities, people got mad, lots of them left after the 2nd wipe and I thought it might be better to leave as well. I looked up a raid guide and there were so many things I'd have to remember and play around, that I'm too scared now to give it another shot and getting flamed again.

That's why I decided to look for a guild. I asked in trade chat every 15 minutes or so and even put up a forum post, wich got absolutely no attention.
I made clear that I'm new to the game but want to learn as much as possible and that I have the time for it as well.

I didn't get a single answer and now I'm kind of lost. I really wanna raid, even if it's not as a tank. I just don't know how to get there and feel a bit left behind.

1307,Possibly way to bring back Gilneas & Lordaeron.,"So i was listening to the Wolfheart book, and during it there is a section where Genn talks about reclaiming Gilneas one day, so i looked up the current status on what is up with Gilneas, and apparently there are inconsistency's on whether or not the forsaken have it under their control, or if it was all just blighted, but i think Blizzard could easily retcon some things, and give it a definitive answer. 

I think the best way to go about this, would be to claim that the city was in fact blight bombed entirely, and the undead were in control of the city, essentially just keeping it under their control so the gilneans couldn't reclaim it. Now, with the horde and alliance now claiming to be at peace, a sign of good faith could be for the horde to turn over control back to the alliance, and even assist in removing the blight from the city. This would allow for a replacement city to Darnassus, and would give the Worgens and newly homeless Night elves, a place to call home, and Genn would be able to repay his debt to the Night elves.

 Now, i know if they were to do this for one side, they would realistically need to do it for both, and they could easily bring back Lordaeron through similar methods, but instead of returning to the undercity, they would return to the above ground city of lordaeron, and rebuild above ground. Similar situation could play out where both factions go into Lordaeron to clear out the blight, and start rebuilding. This would make sense because it seems like the Forsaken would rather return to a city of their own, and with everything happening with Caliea, it would fit in with the story.. I could see her now saying something along the lines of ""In this new chapter for the forsaken, we will not hide underground any longer, we are proud members of Lordaeron, let us show it"" or something like that, and they rebuild the city.

This would give us back two new, and unique cities to play around with in the future. Tell me what you think guys.",1570709624.0,"Possibly way to bring back Gilneas & Lordaeron.So i was listening to the Wolfheart book, and during it there is a section where Genn talks about reclaiming Gilneas one day, so i looked up the current status on what is up with Gilneas, and apparently there are inconsistency's on whether or not the forsaken have it under their control, or if it was all just blighted, but i think Blizzard could easily retcon some things, and give it a definitive answer. 

I think the best way to go about this, would be to claim that the city was in fact blight bombed entirely, and the undead were in control of the city, essentially just keeping it under their control so the gilneans couldn't reclaim it. Now, with the horde and alliance now claiming to be at peace, a sign of good faith could be for the horde to turn over control back to the alliance, and even assist in removing the blight from the city. This would allow for a replacement city to Darnassus, and would give the Worgens and newly homeless Night elves, a place to call home, and Genn would be able to repay his debt to the Night elves.

 Now, i know if they were to do this for one side, they would realistically need to do it for both, and they could easily bring back Lordaeron through similar methods, but instead of returning to the undercity, they would return to the above ground city of lordaeron, and rebuild above ground. Similar situation could play out where both factions go into Lordaeron to clear out the blight, and start rebuilding. This would make sense because it seems like the Forsaken would rather return to a city of their own, and with everything happening with Caliea, it would fit in with the story.. I could see her now saying something along the lines of ""In this new chapter for the forsaken, we will not hide underground any longer, we are proud members of Lordaeron, let us show it"" or something like that, and they rebuild the city.

So, here is the thing. In current AH, if trader wants to get control over prices, he has to buy out all or almost all listings that are cheaper than his for  whatever price they are being sold for.

With new system, a trader can buy just one item from the stack and, if seller of that stuck is doing raid/M+/something else or offline, temporarily take out a competitor with much less money. Seems like it will be easier to gain control of the market.

1380,Blizzcon Prediction for the Future of Warcraft,"So my prediction for after BfA is Warcraft 4. After N'zoth is recaptured (or killed, which will further wound Azeroth) a new faction war will begin. In this Warcraft 4 there will be 4 factions; The Alliance (Humans, Dwarves and Gnomes), The Horde (Orcs, Tauren and Trolls), The Vengeful (Night Elves and The Worgen) and The Fallen (Sylvanas' Forsaken and The Scourge).

Think about it... Have we ever met a big baddie half-way through the expansion we didn't kill THAT expansion? And don't count Guldan, he's cool, but not a BIG baddie. Then after N,zoth... what? And with Nyalotha, visions, assaults, the Wrathion questing and two new races (and 4 heritage armor sets) do you really believe we'll be seeing Tyrande again this expansion? Or discovering Sylvanas's master plan?

So what will occur in Warcraft 4? I believe it will be the arrival of the Void Lords and it will launch WoW into the greater universe. After all, for the most part, we have seen very little of the galaxy and the Old Gods had masters, master which even the Legion were afraid of. If an RTS was in development, perhaps remastering an RTS would have been the first step (which they completed since last blizzcon).

So would WoW be finished? No. WoW is such a large game it exists by itself, but WoW 2 has been mentioned before (it revitalized GW after all) and would have no better launching pad than an RTS which jump-starts a new storyboard. I'm just saying that many people have been interested in new systems such as more RPG elements, new equipment systems, an alternative to the '1-120 grind which is 91.67% pointless to current content', a less rigid faction systems, a more dynamic environment and for a world that is all-relevent and not simply '5% relevant'. A brand new WoW would be the best launching pad for that!",1570685807.0,"Blizzcon Prediction for the Future of WarcraftSo my prediction for after BfA is Warcraft 4.

In this Warcraft 4 there will be 4 factions; The Alliance (Humans, Dwarves and Gnomes), The Horde (Orcs, Tauren and Trolls), The Vengeful (Night Elves and The Worgen) and The Fallen (Sylvanas' Forsaken and The Scourge).

Think about it... Have we ever met a big baddie half-way through the expansion we didn't kill THAT expansion? And don't count Guldan, he's cool, but not a BIG baddie. Then after N,zoth... what? And with Nyalotha, visions, assaults, the Wrathion questing and two new races (and 4 heritage armor sets) do you really believe we'll be seeing Tyrande again this expansion? Or discovering Sylvanas's master plan?

So what will occur in Warcraft 4? I believe it will be the arrival of the Void Lords and it will launch WoW into the greater universe. After all, for the most part, we have seen very little of the galaxy and the Old Gods had masters, master which even the Legion were afraid of. If an RTS was in development, perhaps remastering an RTS would have been the first step (which they completed since last blizzcon).

So would WoW be finished? No. WoW is such a large game it exists by itself, but WoW 2 has been mentioned before (it revitalized GW after all) and would have no better launching pad than an RTS which jump-starts a new storyboard. I'm just saying that many people have been interested in new systems such as more RPG elements, new equipment systems, an alternative to the '1-120 grind which is 91.67% pointless to current content', a less rigid faction systems, a more dynamic environment and for a world that is all-relevent and not simply '5% relevant'. A brand new WoW would be the best launching pad for that!",1

1385,[Theory] New Il'gynoth whispers and their possible meanings.,"Il'gynoth stated in the Emerald Nightmare that he was returning to Ny'alotha after he died. In 8.3, he held true to his promise and will appear as a raid boss in the Ny'alotha raid. With his reapparance, he brings new quotes. These are as follows; 

> 1.Before the last shadow falls, the Father of Sleep shall savor his feast.

> 2.The golden one claims a vacant throne. The crown of light will bring only darkness.

> 3.When their mistress beckons, nine ravens take flight. Each seeks a prize to earn her favor.

> 4.The vassal of life disguises treachery. Beware the eyes of green.

> 5.Five lanterns, now darkened. The flame they seek will light the masters' way.

> 6.The cunning ones kneel before six masters, but serve only one.

> 7.The blind queen wields a scepter of bone. From the deep she calls forth doom.

&nbsp;

**1.Before the last shadow falls, the Father of Sleep shall savor his feast.**

&nbsp;

This refers to  the largely mysterious loa that receives very little reference in game. His name is Ueetay no Mueh'zala, or just Death. 

&nbsp;

In Zul'farrak you can find a tablet from the Sandfury trolls called the Tablet of Theka. On this tablet are the words ""God of Death, Father of Sleep, Son of Time, the Night's Friend."" An exact reference to a father of sleep in WoW, who is also a God of Death. There is also a shrine dedicated to him in Tal'farrak, Dazar'alor, Zuldazar with faint yet still visible shadows around it. 

&nbsp;

With that said we should reevaluate the quote. Before the last shadow falls, Mueh'zala shall savor his feast. Feast? For this I think it's appropriate to look at Mueh'zalas motives, and the Sylvanas-loyalist finale cinematic. So what does Mueh'zala want?

&nbsp;

In the rather unknown book Traveler: The Spiral Path, Mueh'zala says to a protagonist of the story;  ""Not yet, Son of Thorne. Not yet. This is not the day. The day comes. It comes. But Mueh'zala will not engage you here or now. Our battle is yet to come, yet to come... But it will come, child. It will come. And if you lose that battle, Mueh'zala feasts on all of Azeroth. All of Azeroth. All of Azeroth. All of Azeroth...""

&nbsp;

I think his motives remain evident. With that said, we now look at the Sylv-loyalist cinematic. In the cinematic she has three appropriate sentences.


> ""Countless souls have been fed to the hungering darkness.""

&nbsp;

> ""My Bargain with Azshara will yet bear fruit. The armies of Azeroth will fight her master, and he will line their streets with corpses.""

&nbsp;

> ""In the end, he too will serve Death."" 

Side note: The subtitle in the cinematic capitalized Death as if it was a noun. They didn't capitalize life. And the Sandfury happen to oft refer to Mueh'zala as just ""Death"", lending credence to the idea that Sylvanas does serve an entity, and that it may be Mueh'zala.

&nbsp;

In my last post I theorized Sylvanas had become an agent of Death. Her quotes in the cinematic make it obvious she wants Azshara's master (N'zoth) to line the streets with corpses of the armies of Azeroth, and that he will fall and serve Death. In Traveler, Mueh'zala expresses his desire to feed. On all of Azeroth. Taking what we now know and comparing it with the original Il'gynoth quote we get...

> ""Before the last shadow falls, the Father of Sleep shall savor his feast."" 

Translated, it becomes:

&nbsp;
Before N'zoth is to be defeated (The last Old God of Azeroth), Mueh'zala shall savor his feast (of souls, that N'zoth and the armies of Azeroth provide for him).

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**2. The golden one claims a vacant throne. The crown of light will bring only darkness.**

&nbsp;

Though I remain uncertain of this, I believe this is referring to Calia Menethil. She was recently ressurected by a Naaru hence ""The golden one"". The vacant throne referring to the throne of the kingdoms of Lordaeron, which Sylvanas and the forsaken had previously resided underneath, and she is now absent. She could bring ""darkness"" about by providing the Light with an additional chess piece on the board of Azeroth. As X'era, Yrel have demonstrated, the Light is not always a pleasant force to deal with.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**3.When their mistress beckons, nine ravens take flight. Each seeks a prize to earn her favor.**

&nbsp;

This quote I believe utilizes clever wordplay. The mistress I believe is Sylvanas, and her ""ravens"" the Val'kyr. The reason Il'gynoth likened the Val'kyr to ravens however I believe to be no coincidence, for lack of a better animal. This ties in to the next sentence. ""Each seeks a prize to earn her favor"" is possibly not referring to Sylvanas, but to Helya with whom Sylvanas made an unknown bargain. 

&nbsp;

It's important to remember that many of the Val'kyr Sylvanas had bound herself to have died and left the world of the living. If the ""nine ravens"" are truly her Val'kyr, it's likely at least a few of them seek their respective prizes in the shadowlands. A soul perhaps? If so, of who?

&nbsp;

As for their choice wording of ""Raven"" to the Val'kyr's wings; while the  Lord of Ravens referred to in Emerald Nightmare's Il'gynoth remains uncertain (Could have been Khadgar, Odyn, or Medivh) I believe the person whom Il'gynoth is referencing this time is Odyn. In both Norse Mythology and WoW, Odyn/Odin remains both a lord, and master of two ravens at his side. 

&nbsp;

Possibly hinting to the future of WoW, one of the massive stone tablets in the Warrior class hall of Skyhold dictates a story of Odyns intimate relationship with the realm of death. In it, a wraith (likely Mueh'zala) appears to him. This is what follows. 

&nbsp;

> A great spirit appeared to Odyn from this circle, billowing up from ethereal mists, shapeless, to surround the keeper in shadow. ""What will you give,"" the spirit asked, ""to peer beyond the veil of this world?""

> Wise Odyn considered the wraith's question. ""I have two eyes,"" he replied. ""One to see in this world of mortals, and one to see into the realm of spirits."" And with that, Odyn plucked his own eye from his head and presented it to the spirit. The spirit clasped his eye and swallowed it whole, and great Odyn saw.

> Seeing through this given eye, great Odyn saw the Shadowlands. He saw life, saw it even in the land of death, and he was satisfied that his Valarjar would live beyond the mortal realm.
And yet still he saw death. He saw souls in torment, and souls in anguish, and the husks of the dead lay all around him. He saw ghostly wraiths with no face, and others with no form, and all were made of death itself. And as he saw, even the great Odyn, master of the Halls of Valor, chosen of Aman'Thul, was afraid.""

&nbsp;

From many sources in WoW, we know Helya is still eternally infuriated with Odyn for reasons I won't delve into here. It's likely whatever pact Sylvanas made with Helya was to slight Odyn (and possibly the other Titans) at some point in the future. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**4.The vassal of life disguises treachery. Beware the eyes of green.**

&nbsp;

Unsure about this, but it could mean a few things. A vassal is someone below another in position of heirarchy. Eonar, Ysera, Malfurion and Alextrasza serve life. Only the latter three have green eyes, though this could be irrelevant and meant to be read as two separate people. The green eyes could be interpreted in a great many ways, though it could also be about jealousy. 

I have many theories, none more certain than the last. Though I find the final one most interesting. I won't include my theory for Ysera, as its possible context is deserving of a post on its own.

&nbsp;

**Eonar theory**; Her recent addition as a boss in Antorus seemed forced and out of place. It's possible story-seeding (pun intended) for the future of the game. There is a -lot- of correlation with Eonar and current (including 8.3 events). She empowered the dragonflights,  gave power to Freya, Alexstrasza and Ysera over the Emerald Dream (which runs antithetical to the shadowlands, and has been recently invaded by void minions). It's possible she knows something more than what anyone else does about current events / characters ""on the board"" so to speak, and has kept it hidden. 

&nbsp;

**Malfurion theory**: Malfurion, husband of Tyrande has literal green eyes. As we see from the current war campaign text when talking with Anduin, he believes Tyrande could be consumed by revenge and hatred. It's possible she did something treacherous against the Alliance and the leaders hadn't yet discovered it, and Malfurion disguises it. 

&nbsp;

**Alextrasza theory**: Alexstrasza the Life-Binder. It could be argued Alexstrasza was more intimately related with Life than her sister Ysera was. It's possible she has been colluding against her own kind with an unknown force, as a result of the jealousy (green eyes) she might've for another. Given her familiarity with life, perhaps she becomes a Dragon aspect of Death.

&nbsp;

**5.Five lanterns, now darkened. The flame they seek will light the masters' way.**

&nbsp;
Blue (Magic), Bronze (Time), Red (Life), Green (Nature), Black (Earth). I believe this quote is referring to the 5 dragon aspects, as they've lost their immortality (once-burning lanterns, darkened) and they were the final creature-level defense against Old Gods placed upon Azeroth by their titan masters. They were to guide the creatures of Azeroth through a world riddled with darkness, as if figurative lanterns. Perhaps they wish to regain their immortality (flame) and this will play to the favor of N'zoth or another unknown void entity?
Another thing they would seek could be (a fragment of) their soul / power that they had imbued the Demon Soul/Dragon Soul artifact with, which fits into my soul/death-themed interpretations of Il'gynoth's new quotes. 

&nbsp;

**6. The cunning ones kneel before six masters, but serve only one.**

This quote likely refers to the cosmic magic forces of Warcraft chart, as seen in Chronicles Vol.1: https://i.imgur.com/VsOdNOu.jpg. 
There are 6 cosmic types, or figuratively speaking, masters; Life, Holy, Disorder, Shadow(Void), Death, and Order.

I think this was a more generalized quote referring to how more perceptive, intelligent denizens of the universe serving only one is a strategem to live and prosper under them, though this could mean a particular race / entity as well. A friend suggested it may be referring to the Nathrezim, a race of cunning humanoids prevalent in Azerothian history in many cosmic respects.

&nbsp;

**7.The blind queen wields a scepter of bone. From the deep she calls forth doom.**
&nbsp;

Though perhaps lacking some context, I believe the below to be enough to understand the theory. I'll write full context including the below (and more) in a separate post attempting to explain something else entirely.  

A common interpretation of this quote is that the queen is Azshara, Sylvanas, Tyrande or otherwise. I think ""queen"" and ""scepter"" were terms used abstractly to intentionally obfuscate the truth of the quote.

To understand what this means and for some context, we should turn to Tauren Mythology. In it, the Earthmother was saddened to see her people (the Tauren) fall to in-fighting and wickedness. In her grief, she tore out her ""eyes"" and sent them spinning across the skies. Thus making her figuratively blind.  I believe that the Earth Mother has always been the world-soul of Azeroth that we've been acquainted with during so many trips and questline to her Heart in BfA.

Many media releases refer to the World-Soul of Azeroth as the strongest currently-known World Soul in the universe, a soul with such strength and promise that if she were to assume a physical form, she could defeat the Void Lords themselves. Putting her in the highest position of ""Queen"" of titans isn't beyond reason. 

A scepter is something held by a ruler as a physical representation of their royalty or power. Directly above Azeroth's heart happens to be Gorribal, Sargeras' sword. It's wielder was the ruler of the Burning Legion, and upon closer inspection is undeniably crafted with a bone hilt and blade. The entire weapon could be bone even. In an abstract sense, if we equate the World-Soul of Azeroth with the entire planet, she wields the Sword which Sargeras has buried in her.

https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1zwYL8dypJ4/maxresdefault.jpg

And finally ""From the deep she calls forth doom"". The strength of Azeroth is so great that Titans and Void Lords could sense it from across the distant universe. This is what brought Sargeras the Titans and possibly the Old Gods to the planet. 
All of this put together, and rephrased, it reads...

> Original: The blind queen wields a scepter of bone. From the deep she calls forth doom.

Theory: Azeroth has Gorshalach, ""Scepter"" of bone embedded in her. From her chamber, the universe is drawn to her power. 

&nbsp;

\-AP grind sucks

It drives me nuts as someone who is genuinely enjoying playing wow, and raiding at a relatively high end level (currently 6/8M) that all I can seem to surround myself with at that level is people that just want to shit all over the thing they are spending hours doing. Why are you playing if you hate most of the content in it? And none of this is going to change in 8.3 either. HoA looks to be going up to at least lvl 90, the visions things looks like might turn into some form of mandatory content at least for the start of the patch. Some new form of titanforging which I am sure will have some negative aspect the community as a whole will jump on. But you know what? I am going to do all of it. I don't love islands or the AP grind either, but I was the first person in my guild to hit neck level 65 (Aug 18th), and I do it because I love raiding and want to do everything I can to try and progress my character to help my team. It feels to me lately that said mindset has completely evaporated from the community as a whole.

&#x200B;

So do I just have the worst luck in trying to find a new home? Cause I am basically at a crossroads now where I can rough it out with my current raid team and just try to be my own beacon of positivity for myself, or I potentially have to deal with the negative reaction of having to tell recruitment officers that I would be leaving my second guild in just shy of two months and being labelled as a guild hopper.",1570679423.0,"Do people even want to play the game anymore?So my guild recently fell apart, and I have been forced into the world of trying to find a new home.

I played 21 hours on classic launch with no problems but now I cannot get through a single dungeon on my warrior. Mostly pain in my ring and middle finger on my left (keyboard) hand.

Now I do understand that Prot warrior is very very spammy, you are literally 100% GCD locked because even if you dont have rage or cd's you always have devastate, therefore there should NEVER be a GCD where you are not pressing a button, as I said I left my most recent dungeon after 2 bosses because I couldn't continue.

After a small break I went and played several games of overwatch and had some pain but maybe only 5-10% of what I had in wow. I guess this is because Overwatch is mostly wasd and the mouse and therefore is a lot easier on my hand where-as wow is esdf12345qwrtgaz and a shift command of all of those.

I don't want to quit the game over this and have only been able to think of 2 possible solutions, and these are the things I'm here to ask about.

1. Play a less spammy class

I have always tried to play the fastest class I could (Prot warrior, Fury warrior, Ench shaman, ect.) it's just what I find fun, what would be some possible recommendations for a slower spec/class that are not 100% GCD locked and may help me relieve some pressure. I would prefer a healer or dps, and speaking of healer do you guys think that would be less button presses than a tank or fast dps?

2. Gaming mouse

I had a mouse with a bunch of buttons in the past and I think that putting some of the load onto my right hand may help, I've looked at 2 and was wondering if people had any recommendations for a mouse that I can cast most of my abilities with.

Anyone have experience with either of these or could tell me what they use.

1471,Flight Animations,"**Disclaimer:** I have zero animation background so I‚Äôm not in the best position to provide feedback on this but I‚Äôve never seen it being brought up in a constructive manner before. 

Ever since flying has been introduced in BC, it has never been updated. Yes, new mounts with unique animations are regularly added but the basics of flying (i.e. taking off, maneuvering and landing) have not been updated. Casting animations have been updated and I love them. Perhaps it‚Äôs time to update something we always see and make it as exciting as it was back in BC. 

What I propose:

- Taking off (on a dragon especially) should be accompanied with gusts off wind and feel of thrust. Perhaps mimicking thrust via a game is impossible? But I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs possible to demonstrate via change of speed and a unique animation showing effort. Similar to how Orcs running feels heavier than humans for example. 
- Changing flight direction shouldn‚Äôt be just your mount stagnantly shifting some degrees like a mitre saw. It should have fluidity to it and wings actually being used to indicate direction you‚Äôre going. 
- Similar to taking off, landing can also have slowing down and hovering for a split second beyond what is already in the game. 

- On a side note, would really love to see these new animations while soaring through the clouds.",1570669810.0,"Flight Animations**Disclaimer:** I have zero animation background so I‚Äôm not in the best position to provide feedback on this but I‚Äôve never seen it being brought up in a constructive manner before.

When I launch the game via [Battle.net](https://battle.net/) launcher, I'm only having a black screen (the game is working in the background, just no screen showing at all). Whenever I alt-tab (or cntrl+alt+del) and WoW is in the background, while another task window/task manager is in the front, I can see the game working in the background window. However, whenever I alt-tab again and WoW is in the front, it is showing me a black screen instead.#

1491,Agonizing death of the Alliance continues...,"Seeing people all excited over Vulpera and asking around how to faction change to the Horde... This is killing me inside.

But if we ever complain about imbalance or bias, wow devs close their ears and apologists come out of the woods to defend them. Look at this game's state. Just look at it. Horde does not need any more enticing races to flip people form the Alliance. Alliance needs them. Alliance is the disadvantaged, underpopulated and dying faction. And yet, wow devs keep pushing anything cool, cute and nice thing they can think of to the Horde, leaving Alliance with the scraps. And whenever they do give something to the Alliance, it is either complete trash, or too little too late.

How is it that they look at the state of the game and still think to themselves it is okay to give Vulpera to the Horde and have mechagnomes as an equivalent for the Alliance? Is there not even a single person in the team that goes and says ""these are not even remotely comparable, we have to do better by the Alliance?"" Not even a single one?

It is the same thing ever singe time: Whenever something nice comes, it's for the Horde. Whenever there is an opportunity to give Alliance something nice, it is missed. Mechagnomes are just latest example. They went and chose this above all the other things Alliance actually wanted, and then made the mechagnomes in the worst way possible: Cannot even be transmoged and have no new classes. They had a golden opportunity to give Alliance an amazing new druid race that would actually be cool and desirable, but they didn't. This is not only ugly, but also the least modifiable race and they bring nothing for the Alliance. They could have just been empty slates of place holders and it work function the same way.

Am I wrong to want something nice for the Alliance? Am I ungrateful and entitled for wanting a good race for the Alliance? Do we not need more cool things on the blue side to stop it's death?

But hey! We got a Bee right!

1609,Mount animations are garbage.,"One of the biggest holdovers from [vanilla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koSq-KecPm4) are mount animations, everything from mounting up, dismounting, running, swimming and so on. There was a time during Warlords where the animations (and recolors) were so egregious that they had to edit the speed at which the mount animation activates in order to not look like a choppy mess. With various examples like the [boar running animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIYKiAqZCgE), the [seagull from island expeditions](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/ab57u7/i_spent_1000_doubloons_on_this/) being improperly sized, [mount abilities / items](https://www.wowhead.com/news=291153/mount-equipment-water-walking-and-new-mounts-in-patch-8-2-rise-of-azshara#Comments) being lackluster or outright removed; plenty of public, notable instances of mounts not quite being where Blizzard wants them to be and for players it's one of the main modes of travel as well as a one large portion of a collector's journal.

What would it take to get a mount system overhaul? [Would it be worth it?](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17346287213) That's the discussion I'm trying to engage. Having one person or a team at Blizzard sit down and edit every mount, mount family or category of mounts (land, [flying](https://feralaggression.wordpress.com/2010/01/13/epic-flight-form-ground-mount-bug/), swimming) changed so they didn't arrive in a buff of smoke or having the character hover over the invisible reins as if they're gripping the air for dear life would take entirely too long. It's not cost efficient but it is unlikely that there will be a patch or expansion that necessitates an overhaul of the kind that players clamour for.

We saw some positive examples like the [class mounts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsy5HV9lhac) in Legion. We've seen entirely new animations appear like in Mists. And we've seen a bevy of recolors and lackluster changes like in Warlords or BFA. What would be the biggest draw for attention to this old, outdated, and glaring issue? (It's literally unplayable!)

Is it worth it, or are most people just fine with the way mounts move and how players move on them?

1610,Why so restrictive with Race/Class combos for Allied Races?,"So I was probably one of the 0.001% of the playerbase who was actually hyped for Mechagnomes. I was that guy who used the Robo-Gnomebulator and Reflecting Prisms on everyone in the BG to turn us into the real thing. I finally made the switch to FFXIV a few months ago, but told myself at the time that if the Mechagnome racials were cool, I might switch back.

But they can't even be Paladins! I was so hyped to worship the Spark instead of the Light. Of the 10 Allied Races added so far, only 3/10 can be Paladins. For Druid, it's the same: 3/10.

FFXIV has no Race/Class restrictions at all. Obviously, I am not advocating for this in WoW, as I understand that, say, an ORC Paladin has far more incongruous lore consequences than a Lalafell Lancer or whatever.

But I do wish they were looser. Goblins and Worgen, for example, just got all this cool new stuff, but they still can't be Monks, despite having all of the animations available in the in-game files!

The introduction of Night Elf Paladins, [two](https://www.wowhead.com/champion=756/delas-moonfang) of [which](https://ptr.wowhead.com/champion=1000/nerus-moonfang) were included in the Legion Order Hall, could have been an interesting development in the people of Teldrassil seeking vengeance against the Forsaken. Unfortunately, that storyline, despite sparking the events of the entire expansion, seems to have been forgotten entirely in favor of humans, dragons, and tentacles.

Do they want us to be excited for these new races and justify their prohibitive rep grind, or not? When they let Night Elves be Mages in the Cataclysm, the game didn't collapse in on itself.

I‚Äôm ilevel 330 and I need 345 to do heroics, I know in the past it was usually best to do dungeons to increase ilevel, is this still the case or should I be doing something else?

Also are island expeditions and warfronts the best way for leveling my heart of Azeroth or is there some sort of catch up mechanic? Someone mentioned going straight to nazjatar but that I may not be able to survive with my ilevel, can anyone elaborate on this?

1732,Troubleshooter rambles about: The Bard Class,"Ah yes, the Bard. Every now and then it comes up as a requested class, but it fails to get much enthusiasm. The most common issues seems to be to make the Bard ""fit in"", while keeping it unique enough to make it worth adding. This is not a surprise, as Bard classes in RPG's often have the reputation of being a ""jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none"" or a boring support class. 

The odds of the class ever being implemented are thus next to zero, but a wandering minstrel can dream, right? So please stay a while and read: Here are my thoughts on the idea of a Bard class in Warcraft. 

**Class Description**  
*""Jack-of-all-trades, masters-of-none: Bards combine their artistic talent with their broad knowledge of the world and varied skill set to seek out inspiration for their next masterpiece, fame and fortune, or to simply enjoy the thrill of adventuring and exploring.""*

**Harmony Specialization (Healer)**  
""*Development of their knowledge of druidic and shamanistic lore allows the Bard to infuse their musical performance with praise to the spirits of nature, the elements, the light and life, bringing harmony to all those interconnected forces.""* 

A highly mobile healer due to being based around on-the-move, casted healing spells.   
Aesthetically the spells would display various light/water/life effects and musical notes as a lute, flute or drum is played in the character's hands and a short tune is played. Perhaps with little singing birds to satisfy your inner Disney princess.  
The mechanic or ""gimmick"" of this spec would be to play these healing tunes in specific 3-4 spell chains to gain certain party wide effects. 

Armor: Chain  
Weapons: 1H weapons, Offhand items, Shields. 

**Discord Specialization (Melee DPS)**  
*""Delving into arcane and shadow magic can be dangerous and the more 'unhinged' Bards find that sometimes their 'performance' is better suited to distracting, confusing and harassing the enemy, rather than inspiring their comrades.""*

A unpredictable melee combatant who uses, lots of noise, arcane/shadow magical trickery and unpredictable movement. Aesthetically the abilities look like distorted music notes, blinding flashes, instrument smashing, sparks, wild movement, whistling, scary illusions and arcane tricks. This one is a cavorting, howling fool who is so random, not even he knows what he will do next. This specs mechanic would revolve around trying to follow a randomly generated spell/attack sequence to inflict various debuff+damage effects on their enemies. In a world of spell rotations and priorities, the Discord Bard goes his own way. 

Armor: Chain  
Weapons: Dual wield 1H weapons. 

**Symphony Specialization (Ranged/Melee DPS)**  
*""The Bard has learned to compose a fluid combat style using various weapon styles picked up over the years, making his bow and sword do the singing.""*

A highly mobile melee/ranged combatant. Mobile ranged attacks are strung into a chain that builds up a momentum resource that, when full, unlocks a dashing attack move into into melee range, where a follow-up melee ability chain can be executed. Completing the melee chain makes the Bard dash back out of the fray.   
Aesthetically this would look like the Bard is twirling, dancing and doing all the cool and over-the-top flashy moves we see archer archetypes do in Hollywood movies and game cinematics. This Bard likes to show off to intimidate and entertain.

Where and how do trolls get paladins, how does a 120 hunter out heal the healer and wow i want and need a maghar orc in my life, At the rate I'm going 120 won't be hard to obtain so i have a couple of questions.

1,  How do i unlock the Maghar, is it simply grinding rep like dailies or wearing a tabard in instances

2, Professions, do they matter or should i just not worry

1771,sadpost.exe,"Finally joined WoW 3 months ago after many, many years of waiting to play a game I thought I loved since I was a kid. When I was around 10 years old, I've been watching my friends play the WOTLK expansion, exploring massive areas of land and fighting through Naxxramas while I was begging my parents to buy a decent computer (my country was, and still is, very poor. Eastern Europe). I am 21 now and I have a part-time job while I'm in university. I've bought a 6 month membership in order to play with my childhood friend, the one who has showed me the game in the first place. 

3 months later, I don't feel like playing the game anymore. My friend is a guild officer and he's always too busy doing raids with the guild we're both in. After 2 months of 4-8 hours/day gametime I've been stuck between Legion and BfA questlines after getting bored of finishing dungeons and quests all by myself. My iLevel is 360 now, but every time I'm trying to learn how to play my class in a raid, people are being toxic with me for ""doing it on purpose"". They look at my items then say ""yeah sure, a noob with an ilevel over 350. \*kick\*""

&#x200B;

I really don't know what to do now. Three months to go and no one I can play a multiplayer game with. Most early dungeons and raids **in the current expansion** are empty. Not to mention that I cannot play WOTLK alone on a lvl 60-70 character. I had the pleasure to play it on my level 120 just to experience the story, but I just know it is not the same.

 I wish Blizzard did a better job at welcoming and matching up new players.",1570603024.0,"sadpost.exeFinally joined WoW 3 months ago after many, many years of waiting to play a game I thought I loved since I was a kid.

I especially enjoy healing in random battlegrounds and after taking a long break since early BFA I've decided to try a priest as a healer in battlegrounds. I've spent alot of time healing with my monk and shaman and have done well on those two, they offer good mobility and lots of cc to escape danger. The priest on the other hand, feels like I am nothing more than a pinata for the enemy team regardless if I play disc or holy. I've had somewhat better success playing disc but still, 2 enemies are always the death of me, when if I was on my monk half a raid could bear down on me and I would still be able to heal my mates. 

Does anyone have tips or can point me in the direction to get help healing as a priest specifically in battlegrounds?. It's depressing to say the least. 1 rogue focuses me and I'm almost dead. I really want to make it work as priest is something I haven't really played at all.

1781,Dear Blizzard: Embrace Flying!,"Dear Blizzard,

**Embrace flying. For fucks sake.**

Every time I hear one of the devs say that ‚ÄúPathfinder is an elegant compromise‚Äù ‚Ä¶  just ... ***no***. ***No***.

***It‚Äôs not.*** **Stop.**

Like let‚Äôs think about it: Blizzard had a chance to ***prove*** that no flying was great in Warlords of Draenor ‚Äî and it didn‚Äôt work. That‚Äôs it. Now you have to embrace it. Now you have to do something cool with it.

You remember in the Burning Crusade where you did something cool with flying? Do you remember in Wrath of the Lich King where you did something cool with flying? And then do you remember when you just like, let us fly in Cata? Do you remember how many people complained?

***None.*** **Nobody complained. Everybody was fine with it.**

And then it became a problem. Not a problem for the players ‚Äî a problem for Blizzard. They didn‚Äôt like it anymore. People were missing out on their content and I get it. I totally get it. I even made a video that flying is probably one of Blizzard‚Äôs biggest regrets about World of Warcraft.

***I. Get. It***. I understand it. But‚Ä¶

It is too late ‚Äî **it is far too late.** My biggest problem with Pathfinder isn‚Äôt just that people believed that they‚Äôre working towards unlocking it because they‚Äôre doing world quests ‚Äî world quests are not work by the way ‚Äî and also that they‚Äôre *skipping* content because they‚Äôre traveling to that content faster and skipping nothing. I get that it de-populates the world, that‚Äôs my biggest argument, I understand it.

But Pathfinder is fucking **dumb.** Pathfinder makes **no fucking sense.**

***Why*** would I ever have to convince a fish person ***whose been under the sea for 10,000 years to like me in order to be able to fly?***

*‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm going to be in the U.S. soon and I‚Äôm going to order a car, I‚Äôm just wondering what I need to do? I..I got a dog. Yeah, he loves me? I‚Äôm asking about driving? Oh, he needs to really love me? Exalted? Hey \[to puppy\] do you love me? Eh? Please? Got any dailies?‚Äù*

And this was a problem Blizzard solved years ago. You remember in Northrend in Wrath of the Lich King, we had to teach our mounts to *fly in cold weather at* high altitudes in one of the coldest parts of Azeroth? We had to make sure they would work. That makes some sort of logical sense. It fits into the game world. It fits in the narrative.

My problem with the whole Pathfinder and flying situation is that at this point *it feels childlish.* *It feels spiteful.* It feels like, ‚Äú*Well, you‚Äôre making us giving to you, but we‚Äôll drip feed it to you months and months and months after the game being out.‚Äù*

Why? You have something wonderful here. Flying can be great. We‚Äôve seen it before. Flying can be amazing. Embrace it! Build the world with it in mind. This is all your choice. Instead of being like a resentful child ‚Äî because that‚Äôs all it comes across in the moment.

I don't know if this is because we now have Classic and we can experience back all the ""I'll be patient and helpful"" thing. But this evening something really cool happened to me, and I swear, I have never had something similar until now (playing since mid cataclysm).  


I've queued up in a group of 3 dps, for ""Mechagon, first time"". And basically I have no experience in that dungeon, so I could perfecly fit in! They accepeted me, and a few seconds later an healer showed up.  


We welcome each other and we start the trash pulls, we eventually die because they hit like trucks, but we manage to do the first boss at the first try. Then, super proud of ourselves, we go at the ""Green Blob Boi"" as I call it, but ehm... well we die a lot. No need to go around it, we get smashed like dolls. Like 7 or 8 times. But on every wipe, we bond more, we joke on it, and we give advices to ourselves. After one our we managed to kill this shitty blob.   


We manage even to kill the duo boss, after a couple of wipes, using only the knowledge from the journal.   


But, as all the things, it must have an end.

""Yeah, I know. Hard week on work ye?""  
""Yup, I'm not 13 yo anymore, damn it!""  
""Nooooooo, don't go now, I had a lot of fun!""

1826,New Game Feature Idea: The Profession Guild,"**The Profession Guild**

**What is The Profession Guild?**

The Profession Guild is a coalition of all the master craftsmen across Azeroth, combining their expertise and labor to create powerful items to help the war effort.

**How does it work?**

Players join The Profession Guild and contribute crafting materials towards items. That once completed will be put on The Profession Guilds Auction House (PGAH) for sale (at fixed prices set by Blizzard), for player guilds to purchase. Note the PGAH is separate from the normal Auction House.

**How do player guilds purchase items from the PGAH?**

Player guilds can earn King‚Äôs Commission or Warchief‚Äôs Boon by participating in, dungeons, mythic+, BGs, rated BGs, arenas, and raids as a guild, that can then be spent at the PGAH.

There are two options for how currency is distributed:

Option 1: All currency earned are sent to the guild bank for the officership to decide what items to purchase.

Option 2: Players individually receive the currency to spend themselves and can trade them freely between their guild members.

**What are the crafting materials needed to make the items?**

Crafting materials needed range from things we can already gather now from mining, herbalism, skinning, blacksmithing, enchanting, alchemy, etc. To new materials that you can obtain by doing Profession Guild events all over Azeroth.

**What are the events?**

Hunt down rare creatures, raid Naga supply lines, aid in spelunking expedition, etc. Some of these events will require players to group up to defeat difficult foes and acquire rare materials.

**How do I contribute to a specific item?**

To save on bag space you can mark a specific item in the Profession Guild catalogue that you want to work on and every crafting material you find/make will be sent directly towards the item you‚Äôre helping to craft. Alternatively you could choose to hold onto the crafting materials in your bag/bank to keep for a rainy day.

**What does the Profession Guild offer its members?**

Depending on how much you contributed to an item, when that item is completed and put up for auction you earn Profession Guild Tokens (PGT) to spend on Profession Guild member items like mounts, tabards, pets, etc. You can also purchase Guild Stock to move up in the Guilds ranks which unlock more rewards and interesting benefits.

**What are the ‚Äúbenefits‚Äù for ranking up in the Guild?**

As you purchase more stock in the Profession Guild you move through the ranks gaining access to followers and perks that you can purchase with PGT, that helps you as you travel across Azeroth hunting for materials to help craft powerful items. You also gain access to more sets, mounts, tabards, toys, etc. At the end of each month the top 11 players who purchased the most Guild Stock join The Masters Table.

**What are followers and perks?**

Followers work just like they do now. Head to the missions board and send them out to gather lesser materials for you. Purchasing perks gives you a weekly buff that aids you as you adventure across Azeroth e.g: improved mount speed.

**What is The Masters Table?**

The top 11 players who bought the most stock each month are allowed access to The Masters Room. Where they can vote on how to allocate Profession Guild resources for each week of that month, by selecting a mission and time for that mission that will be carried out the following week. The mission will be open to all players, and can be stopped by the opposing faction. Should the mission succeed, all players will be able to gather double the resources. If the mission fails the opposing faction earn materials.

**What type of ‚ÄúPowerful Items‚Äù does the Profession Guild craft that player guilds can buy from the PGAH?**

&#x200B;

* Mythic level gear.
* Extra bonus roll for everyone in their guild.
* Items that allow you to Titanforge/Warforge gear.
* Azerite Power
* Cauldrons that provide weeklong flasks.
* Items that don‚Äôt provide any value other than fun (e.g: turning your raid into moonkins or causing everyone to start launching fireworks).
* Etc.

**How does PvP work with The Profession Guild?**

Beat other players out in the world to obtain materials from their corpse. Help with the Master Table missions, and head out to pillage opposing faction storehouses. Storehouses are guarded caches in random capital cities and towns that players can hunt down and attack.

**What does this feature provide?**

The Profession Guild provides players with an option outside of raiding and BGs that feeds back into those aspects of the game. While adding to server communities by incentivizing players to work together and communicate. This feature also reduces RNG with gear and helps raiders/pvpers maintain AP.

Note: There is only one Profession Guild for each faction on each server. Also The Profession Guild is completely separate from regular player guilds.

1839,Is Ny'alotha ONLY a new raid and not an actual zone in 8.3? I'm fearing the worst.,"I can't help but notice that on the ptr we can't actually visit Ny'alotha, which is all but normal considering Nazjatar took a few weeks on the PTR before it was available to test, HOWEVER:

No where in the announcement video did Ion mention anything about Ny'alotha being a zone we could actually visit with questing content in it, and in fact, from the datamining that has be exhaustively done, the two new factions for 8.3 are Uldum and Vale from what we can tell. Are those meant to be our questing hubs? Do we not actually get to explore Ny'alotha outside of an instanced raid version of it? To make my suspicions worse, in the bulletin of ""Features"" for 8.3 that has been both shown in the announcement video as well as Blizzard's website, it only mentions Ny'alotha as ""New Raid: Ny'alotha the Waking City,"" and does NOT mention any new zones.

Now, it would seem silly to have an end expansion patch without a NEW open world zone (complete with World Quests and story quests) to explore, especially considering Legion had THREE zones to explore in its final expansion patch. Is Blizzard trying to brush this detail quietly under the rug until more people figure it out, or do you think we will get Ny'alotha as a zone to explore in a later PTR build?

Personally, I am thinking the worst: We aren't getting Ny'alotha as a zone. Only a raid. At least in 8.3. It's possible that we won't be ""done"" in Ny'alotha in 8.3, and we will in fact be exploring it fully as a new questing continent in 9.0, but that is hugely pure speculation at this point.

Thoughts? I just wanna see what everyone else thinks, and if other people will be as disappointed as I will be should Ny'alotha just be reduced to a raid instance that we will never get to fully explore in an open world.",1570593992.0,"Is Ny'alotha ONLY a new raid and not an actual zone in 8.3?

Are those meant to be our questing hubs? Do we not actually get to explore Ny'alotha outside of an instanced raid version of it? To make my suspicions worse, in the bulletin of ""Features"" for 8.3 that has been both shown in the announcement video as well as Blizzard's website, it only mentions Ny'alotha as ""New Raid: Ny'alotha the Waking City,"" and does NOT mention any new zones.

Now, it would seem silly to have an end expansion patch without a NEW open world zone (complete with World Quests and story quests) to explore, especially considering Legion had THREE zones to explore in its final expansion patch. Is Blizzard trying to brush this detail quietly under the rug until more people figure it out, or do you think we will get Ny'alotha as a zone to explore in a later PTR build?

Personally, I am thinking the worst: We aren't getting Ny'alotha as a zone. Only a raid. At least in 8.3. It's possible that we won't be ""done"" in Ny'alotha in 8.3, and we will in fact be exploring it fully as a new questing continent in 9.0, but that is hugely pure speculation at this point.

Thoughts? I just wanna see what everyone else thinks, and if other people will be as disappointed as I will be should Ny'alotha just be reduced to a raid instance that we will never get to fully explore in an open world.",1

1853,What you think they are going to announce for BlizzCon 2019?,"It has cross my mind that I don‚Äôt think Blizzard has anything coming for us WoW players concerning the online MMORPG. As far as it goes we have not defeated the end game boss yet for BFA or seen the outcome. I do not expect an expansion announcement or cinematic for this years BlizzCon. 

Classic is too new and I don‚Äôt think anything surprising or unexpected will come to this side of the coin. 

Warcraft 3 reforge will release this year and I don‚Äôt see anything coming from this series. 

Starcraft 2 seems to be at its end concerning major content, but it‚Äôs Esports side is still alive. I don‚Äôt see a Starcraft 3 since the series did end at 2 and I don‚Äôt see a remake of the originals since it would over step on Starcraft 2, which is not fully outdated graphically. 

Overwatch is up in the air. There has been rumors of single player content, but nothing concrete. I doubt an overwatch 2 will be announced since it just got released for switch. Outside of a new game mode/event, character, or map there is nothing to expect, but only hope. 

Hearthstone is nothing new. It‚Äôs a new expansion and nothing ground breaking. 

Hero‚Äôs of the storm seems to be dead and gone with barely any attention given to it. I doubt we will see anything from this series besides minor tweaks. 

Diablo. So we can safely bet this will be the headliner from last years screw up of Immortal. It‚Äôs very expected that Diablo 4 or a remake will be announced. I don‚Äôt think they will both be announced just one or the other. Diablo immortal will be available immediately on mobile. 

New IP are not easy for Blizzard to just throw out. we had success like overwatch and flops like HoTs. I don‚Äôt think Blizzard has anything this year concerning a new IP since they didn‚Äôt hint on anything major that I know of.

1953,Blizzard should eliminate factions as a rigid game mechanic and introduce more player choice,"With the story developments over the last few patches, it is clear that Blizzard wants to break the cycle of the Alliance and Horde warring with times of temporary respite to fight big bosses.  Although there are certainly some weaknesses in the story we've received so far (e.g., Tyrande and the Night Elves being sidelined), if Blizzard is successful in changing the pattern of Horde/Alliance relations and bringing some variety to the story, it will be good for everyone from a narrative perspective.  Coming immediately out of the story we have now, I could easily see Tyrande breaking away from the mainline Alliance (joined by Genn and the Worgen?), and Sylvanas reappearing to marshal a renegade group of Forsaken.  This also frees up the races and factions for more interesting stories in the future. 

But this doesn't really work as long as players are locked into rigid factions with set groups of races.  The good news is that we have already seen some hints in how to handle this from a player perspective in the choices that were given to Horde players around the Sylvanas loyalist quests.  Blizzard should turn that approach up to 11: get rid of player factions as a rigid mechanic, and replace factions with stories and quest lines that give players choices about how to proceed through an expansion.  If there is a split between Tyrande and Anduin, a night elf druid should be able to follow Tyrande and see the story from that perspective, while a human paladin should be able to follow Anduin (or vice versa, if you really want to as a player).

Blizzard has already executed this kind of approach with the Class Halls in Legion.   In addition to narrative variety, there can be various other rewards tied to splinter faction choices--armor sets, mounts, other cosmetics, etc.  Players following Tyrande, for example, could earn that sweet night elf armor, updated saber mounts, and appropriate titles.  Removing the rigid two-faction system also serves the purpose of allowing players to run with friends who may prefer playing a race that traditionally belonged to the other faction, eliminating balance problems on servers that lean heavily Horde or Alliance, and opening up more interesting choices for roleplaying.",1570579248.0,"Blizzard should eliminate factions as a rigid game mechanic and introduce more player choiceWith the story developments over the last few patches, it is clear that Blizzard wants to break the cycle of the Alliance and Horde warring with times of temporary respite to fight big bosses.

First my specs:

Ryzen 3600VEGA 56 Sapphire16GB 3200mhzDeepcool 700W BronceSSD 220GBHDD 1TB

I use the ssd for system only files, and HDD to install anything else.

Windows 10 Pro OS Build 18362.356

To put it simple, whenever I get on any game I was getting ""World of wacraft Could not start up 3D Acceleration"". I did many thing nothing worked and I decided to format again the PC , now is not giving me this problem but Im seeng poligons and lines also freeze image all of this on World of warcraft, classic and retail. other games were fine but after some time I couldnt access getting ""Game.exe"" has been blocked from accessing Graphic Hardware but since I formated the PC I havent download yet other games to see how are they working.

What I tried:

Clean installation of Video drivers.Regedit TrlDelay 8Exclude from Antivirus / Firewall / Access Folders.Compatibility view Windows 7/8/Vista / Run as Admin / Full screen optimization.System Troubleshoot.Disable any overlay : MSI AFTERBURN /DISCORD / OR ANY XBOX LIVE , basically anything that says Overlay I disable it and without disabling anything.Updating the windows till last version give me the error .... so that I think was the main issue.Update Chips/sata/ display etc...

Use Dirext 11Legacy/11/12The only thing I havent try is to use a different version of windows one with older version of windows... to see if this fix it...

&#x200B;

Let me remember guys that I had to format the pc cuz it was giving me 2 error...

World of Warcraft cant start up 3D Acceleration

And the other error was being display on all games with ""Game.exe"" Has been block from accessing Graphic hardware.

&#x200B;

Just in case you may think that the video card is faulty, it isnt, till the last windows update any game BF 5 / GEARS OF WAR 5/ THE DIVISION 2 /MODERN WARFARE ALL OVER 85+ FPS ON ULTRA and 50\*C

The only game having issues was WOW and still for some time it worked well at ultra with 85-120 fps stable at ultra., but now after the last patch, all the games had the graphic hardware denied....

After the format of the PC no errors being display but.

I installed other games now and they arent blocked anymore and working fine, but WoW still has poligons and traingles and stuff everywhere and freeze for a second minimize and comes up again. The only way I can play wow is by using Windowed mode and use recommend setting 9/10 cuz if I use 10/10 it fucks up again....

2040,Every race should have access to every class.,"- Human - Shaman, Druid

Humans in fantasy as a general rule are the most versatile race. Also, they've spent enough time around their Night Elven and Dwarven friends to learn about this lifestyle, and now with Kul Tiran influence on Stormwind society, I think it makes sense for Humans to start learning Shamanism and Druidism.

- Dwarf - Druid

Why not? They already have a very close relationship to mountain flora and fauna, and are expert hunters and skinners with a great respect for their animal prey. They understand the natural balance.

- Night Elf - Paladin, Shaman, Warlock

Really, anyone should be able to look into demonology and soul-harvesting; especially a race whose souls - wisps - are relatively easy pickings. As for Shaman, the kal'dorei already have an intimate relationship with the land, especially now with Teldrassil gone and Darkshore in utter ruins, they need help from the elements to defend and rebuild. Paladin is a no-brainer - there's few more zealous about the Light of their Mother Moon than them.

- Gnome - Paladin, Shaman, Druid

If Gnomes can be Priests and even Warriors, they could be Paladins. Shaman and Druid, I think it just appeals to their natural curiosity - learning more about the land and local wildlife to better their scientific understanding.

- Draenei - Rogue, Warlock, Druid

Warlock is easy. Already a close relationship with demons, there would be few who would go down the dark path but maintain the strength to not be completely corrupted, especially now with the Legion's scheming masters gone. Rogues, same reason - anyone can become an assassin. Druid, same reason as dwarves - Azuremyst needs a lot of restoration, perhaps with plans to return to Argus to terraform it?

- Worgen - Paladin, Shaman, Monk

The *first* combat style that would appeal to a Worgen loyalist would be using their own giant paws and claws to fight, with their natural agility and keen senses. Paladins, well, they have that cathedral in the center of their town, and a keen sense of justice and righteousness already. Shaman, they have the Gilnean peninsula to restore and pull Duskhaven from the depths.

- Orc - Paladin, Priest, Druid

It's long overdue for Orcs to consider the Light as a path to quelling their natural bloodlust, or simply to put it to better use, for more righteous causes. And very long overdue for picking up Druidism from their Tauren friends - there's already an orc Druid in Warspear anyway.

- Undead - Paladin, Shaman, Druid

Easier than you might think - there's already an undead Paladin at Light's Hope. The people of Lordaeron were fervent devotees of the Light, with their Order of the Silver Hand. Now without Sylvanas, they're free to choose a more righteous path through undeath. For Shamanism, they already have a close relationship with the 'very land' of Tirisfal, with rumors of something alive lurking beneath it. Druidism is a no-brainer - death is an extremely important part of the life cycle - undead Druids would represent this perfectly.

- Tauren - Rogue, Mage, Warlock

Grimtotem already has Warlocks and Rogues; they could easily go the way of the Dark Iron and reintegrate into Tauren society. And Mage, well anyone can pick up the Arcane arts. I've never seen a Tauren scholar before but they must be out there.

- Troll - Paladin

Honestly I'm just thinking about a voodoo Paladin drawing power from the Loa, and that sounds pretty frickin' sweet. And, Zandalari Paladins passing on the knowledge to their bruddas.

- Blood Elf - Shaman, Druid

Same reasons as the Night Elves - Quel'thalas is still in ruins from the Scourge's march nearly 20 years ago. There's a lot of work to do to restore it to its former shining glory - and help from their Horde allies would give them all the techniques they would need.

- Pandaren - Paladin, Warlock, Druid

Zealotry is something the Pandaren have in spades; I'm surprised they haven't tried combining the Light with martial prowess already. Druid as well, given their intimate relationship with their land, and culture of balance and harmony. Warlock is easier to justify now that they're off Pandaria and away from the Sha, but also using dark magic in sensible moderation would make sense as well.

So there you have it; my reasoning for every race having every class. The only things I couldn't justify are Demon Hunters for non-elven races, DK's for races not participating in the Third War, and a lot of stuff for the allied races is a bit harder a sell, especially when unique identity is their purpose in the first place.

Easier than you might think - there's already an undead Paladin at Light's Hope. The people of Lordaeron were fervent devotees of the Light, with their Order of the Silver Hand. Now without Sylvanas, they're free to choose a more righteous path through undeath. For Shamanism, they already have a close relationship with the 'very land' of Tirisfal, with rumors of something alive lurking beneath it. Druidism is a no-brainer - death is an extremely important part of the life cycle - undead Druids would represent this perfectly.

- Tauren - Rogue, Mage, Warlock

Grimtotem already has Warlocks and Rogues; they could easily go the way of the Dark Iron and reintegrate into Tauren society. And Mage, well anyone can pick up the Arcane arts. I've never seen a Tauren scholar before but they must be out there.

- Troll - Paladin

Honestly I'm just thinking about a voodoo Paladin drawing power from the Loa, and that sounds pretty frickin' sweet. And, Zandalari Paladins passing on the knowledge to their bruddas.

- Blood Elf - Shaman, Druid

Same reasons as the Night Elves - Quel'thalas is still in ruins from the Scourge's march nearly 20 years ago. There's a lot of work to do to restore it to its former shining glory - and help from their Horde allies would give them all the techniques they would need.

- Pandaren - Paladin, Warlock, Druid

Zealotry is something the Pandaren have in spades; I'm surprised they haven't tried combining the Light with martial prowess already. Druid as well, given their intimate relationship with their land, and culture of balance and harmony. Warlock is easier to justify now that they're off Pandaria and away from the Sha, but also using dark magic in sensible moderation would make sense as well.

So there you have it; my reasoning for every race having every class. The only things I couldn't justify are Demon Hunters for non-elven races, DK's for races not participating in the Third War, and a lot of stuff for the allied races is a bit harder a sell, especially when unique identity is their purpose in the first place.

Feel free to criticize my nonsense.",1

2073,Do you think the PvP talent system works?,"I just returned back from a long hiatus (since pre-PvP talents) and the PvP talent system feels so weird to me. I think the 'PvP trinket' talent works, but any of the ones that are class/spec-specific like for example 'Bane of Havoc' for Destruction warlocks are so abrupt, especially the ones that are active, but even the passive ones doesn't feel right to me.

Why would my character suddenly use an almost strictly inferior version of a spell if he *clearly* knows how to use the 'better' version just because he enters a door(Havoc being the almost-strictly-worse version of Bane of Havoc).

Personally, I think the PvP talents needs to go. They were meant (I think) as a way to balance PvP and PvE separately, but there are many other ways of doing so (and I'm fairly certain they already do that), but suddenly losing abilities inside dungeons is so *weird*.

2108,Point of mythic raiding nowadays?,"Hi,

I've joined the game back in August after being absent since Pandaria. A friend convinced me to try it out again, so I thought, why not.

&#x200B;

I rolled a Brewmaster since I am not averse to tanking (and all of my friends are DPS anyway) which is relatively fun. I got into a mythic raid group a month ago, but I'm basically forced to play Windwalker since it seems that no one on my server is ever looking for tanks. We've been hard stuck on Ashvane for three weeks now with zero improvements in sight. Unfortunately finding another group on my server seems impossible as no one is looking for melee DPS either, and certainly not Windwalkers. 

&#x200B;

So at this point I'm asking myself if I even want to continue doing this. I never really checked out the itemlevels from previous tiers but it appears that the stuff you could get in the previous raid tier in mythic is just as good as what is currently the normal tier. Is this expected to continue with the next patch? Because honestly, I don't see why I should even care about mythic raiding anymore since everything will get invalidated within a few months' time. Which makes me even more depressed about the state of the game. The encounters are not really that exciting after experiencing them in three other difficulties anyway.

&#x200B;

What are your thoughts on this? Where do you get your motivation to mythic raid from? Do you just really like the fights? Is it a group of friends? Doing all of it for it to be basically worthless within a few months just seems like a huge waste of time to me.",1570557415.0,"Point of mythic raiding nowadays?Hi,

‚ÄúAfter signing the armistice, the Horde didn't cede any territory, paid no reparations, didn't even say sorry lol. If anything they came out ahead.

That army is now merged with the rebels, while the Humans are forced to conscript farmers, as their soldiers have suffered mass casualties.

The Horde is now the undisputed power in Kalimdor, while having 2 mega cities in the middle of the continents (Suramar city and Dazar'alor) to the Alliance's 1 (Kul'Tiras), heck Broken isles might as well be considered Horde dominated territory since they not only have Surmamar, but Thunder Totem as well, while the Alliance has no mega hub on that mini continent. The Horde still retains a full fledged kingdom in the EK with direct access to the ocean.

2144,What WoW lore really is about,"I've been thinking about this for a while, but never posted since I thought it was an obvious thing, but, in light of recent posts/comments I've seen that this is not true.

Of course, this is my speculation and, for this reason, may be completely incorrect.

&#x200B;

I think that the WoW lore is based on the fight between cosmic forces (the one we saw in the Chronicles books: Light/Shadow, Life/Death, Order/Disorder).  
The first fight we had witnessed was the one brought by Sargeras: Order (Titans) against Disorder (Fel).  
After Sargeras slayed the Pantheon, the balance between Order and Disorder was broken and Disorder grew incredibly more powerful than Order, allowing Sargeras to go on a rampage, destroying worlds and killing puppies.  
In doing so, he was weakening other forces, Life (because he killed or corrupted an enormous number of creatures), Shadow (because he mainly targeted worlds corrupted by the Void) and, maybe, by reflection, (Shadow can exists only where there is Light) also their opposite force (i.e. by weakening Shadow, also Light was weakened).  
That may be the reason why Naaru (being of pure Light) tried so hard to stop the Burning Legion with the Army of Light, even when the main goal of Sargeras was to destroy the Void lords.

This fight ended in Legion, when we helped restoring the Pantheon, thus bringing balance back between Order and Disorder.  
Notice that, probably, before Sargeras turned against the Pantheon, there already was an imbalance between Order and Disorder, since the Titans were freely roaming the Universe, shaping worlds and fighting other forces (Death and Void).  


The second fight we are witnessing right now is between Life and Death.  
Sylvanas is, obviously, fighting for Death, trying to empower it by killing living creatures  
I don't want to put too much details into this because it has already been widely discussed in this expansion, but I think you get the point.

&#x200B;

Now you may wonder: you said that Sargeras weakened Life by killing creatures and by reflection it also weakened Death, how is it possible if now Sylvanas wants to empower it by killing everything?  
That's a nice point, what I think is that a force can only gain an edge over their opposite by creating it THEMSELVES (so when Death takes a life, it gains a little advantage over Life, which takes it back when more creatures are born. But when some other force like Fel kills something, both Life and Death lose in power).

  
The aim of every cosmic force is to gain an edge (without weakening, just by becoming stronger) over their polar opposite, while weakening the other forces.  
This can also explain why we don't see Naaru fighting the Void lords (while they can also become being of pure Void).  
Also we had never seen (before Undeath) a fight between Life and Death (except when Night Elves became immortal maybe).  
Undeath is particular, because it allows to empower Death without weakening Life. So this was the aim of the Lich King or Sylvanas, making Shadow taking an edge over Life, without weakening it, by raising undead.  
If you think about it, undeath is just Life, but ""corrupted"" by Death.  


Similarly, Sargeras realized that, by slaying the Pantheon, Fel actually lost power. So, in Legion, he was trying to bring them back to corrupt them. In this way both Disorder and Order would gain in power, obviously Disorder would have gained more power than Order.  


Some interesting points to discuss, may be the fact that some beings can be of multiple cosmic power at once (Calia Menethil as Death and Light, maybe Eonar as Life and Order, Alleria as Life and Void, paladins as Life and Light and maybe more).

I think this is what is really going on in this World (of Warcraft), for those who haven't, I strongly suggest to read the Chronicles books, especially if you like mythology like me (and also the Silmarillion by Tolkien, but that's another world :P)

2158,What I want to see in the next WoW expansion,"Hi guys,

I am an old WoW player -in fact i play since Wrath release- and now i have swapped to classic, as i believe retail content is very limited and has moved away from the RPG aspect of the game which i enjoy. So with all this going on in wow world, the ""leaks"" about the next expansion, Blizzcon coming etc, i wanna share my thoughts and ideas, on what i wanna see in an upcoming WoW expansion. 

**The world**

Personally, i enjoy the world of the game very much, but i feel they keep adding more lands expanding it, while 90% of it is empty. This new idea of the invasions being in the MoP lands is nice, but i would want to see more of the world being used. 

The leaks and the whole talking about the new expansion being the shadowlands, these new invasions that takes us to another dimension (coming in next patch), as well as my recent experience with WoW classic and how the whole world works, made me think, why instead of keep making new maps, dont just use current, in a different dimention / state?

So my idea is that the new world of the new expansion, being the core-classic land instead, but in a different dimension, a more spooky, dark, rotten death-dimension. If the dimension thing isnt something that fits you, an apocalyptic world of Azeroth would work for me too. We will be back to the old zones or Westfall, Barrens, Tanaris etc but the world will be scary, with dangerous monsters, secrets, world bosses and new open world features and events. 

&#x200B;

**Features**

I will post some of the past features the game had and i wish they come back -in a different form that fits the new expansion-, that i found very interesting, and i believe they gave the game a different taste and overall more things to do, that helped players escape the current routine of farming the same things over and over.

&#x200B;

* **Wintergrasp:**

So old WoTLK had one of my favourite features in the game, the Wintergrasp. It was an epic battle, a defend/siege the castle kind of game in the open world. I remember huge amount of players teaming up to fight against the Castle holder, or to defend their castle, in order to control it for the benefits and the Boss hidding inside. Wintergrasp gave the game a nice, different taste than the regular battlegrounds or raids. I would love to see something similar to be back into the game, with the rewards being linked to many aspects (pve,pvp,questing,achievements) so everyone with any interests in the game,participte to enjoy the benefits the castle will provide.

&#x200B;

* **Timeless Island**

Timeless Island was a feature in MoP, an island full of rare bosses, treasures mini games etc. For me, it was a fun experience, not only for gearing up purposes, but also gameplay wise. I believe BFA's island expenditions should have been timless islands instead. It could have been 3-4 islands close to each other, in the open world (not instanced) where people could gather AP, kill bosses for gear, toys, pets, mounts, usefull items etc. The most important thing here for me, is its in the open world. Islands full of people, working together, having fun. Not an instanced rush-farming run just to get it done.

&#x200B;

* **Mage Tower**

A single player mode where players had to fullfil a (hard) task in order to get a skin for their artifact weapon. Mage Tower was arguably hard, but after you managed to come up with the tactics and make it, the rewards were worth it. I wanna see it coming back as a feature, giving special and unique rewards like weapon/gear transmogs, or being part of the legendary quests i will post below.

&#x200B;

* **Challenge Mode Rewards**

So old mythic+ system were the challenge modes. They were very similar but you were competing with the time, getting golden/silver/bronze medals depending on ur time. Players that managed to have Gold on all dungeons of the expansion, were rewarded with unique class set and mounts or weapons. I believe this is a very nice feature, that gave prestige to those who had those sets and i want those rewards to be back  after complitting all mythic+ dungeons of the expansion at certain level (+15 or higher for example).

&#x200B;

* **Legendary Item Quest**

I dont know about you guys, but i hated the random legendary drops from legion, while i am a huge fun of Shadowmourn. What i wanna see then, is a quest, for a legendary item (prefarably weapon) that after hard work, achievements etc, u will be able to aquire. The quest can be linked to completing the mage tower, get certain dugeons are +15, kill and loot things from raid bosses, craft components at certain places etc. I want to be able to get, a badass legendary weapon after a long journey, after working a lot for it.

&#x200B;

*  **Artifact Weapon**

Last but not least Artifact Weapons. Yes same concept as in legion, but different. At the start of the expansion, we will be given a blue weapon, different for each class. The weapon will also have 2 effect slots. Its ilvl will be upgraded by ""feeding"" other weapons we loot to them. The weapon, will be able to be upgraded up to legendary quality, while Ilvl will have no limit, byt as you progress its ilvl, it will be incrisingly harder to upgrade. u Feeding weapons with effects, (for example: chance on hit: Melee attacks do extra fire dmg on hit) will absorb the effect and taking the empty slot's spot. Finishing the legendary quest line (look above) will enable you to upgrade the weapon to legendary, getting extra stats, power and unique effects.  


&#x200B;

**New Specs - Awakened Classes**

So this awakened class thing is very common with other mmorpgs, but its kinda hard to make in wow. I havent figuered out how to make this awakened class thing, but i am sure people can think how. 

My idea tho, thats linked with what i typed above too, is that each class can work into unlocking a new spec for their class. I know this would be a balance nightmare, but think it could be cool too. Some ideas for the unlocked specs i have:  


* **Reaper / Archangel Priest:**

1. Archangel: A melee dps spec, using a huge Greatsword (as an artifact weapon) dealing holy damage with melee abilities and spells. Think it like Tyrael from DIablo.
2. Reaper: A melee dps spec, using a scyth, or dual wield two scyths, dealing shadow damage with melee abilities and spells: Yes, Mathael from diablo  


* **Mecha Hunter**

So a simple ranged dps, that uses technology for its advantage. Bombs, rockets, robots, missiles shooting towers etc   


* **Blademaster Rogue**

A 2 handed Sword, melee dps using images and high critical chance to deal damage and deceive its opponents. Signature ability being Mirror Image and Omnislash.  


* **Radiance Paladin**

A ranged - aoe magic dps, using book as an off hand to draw spells, using holy and fire abilities to appy judgement on its enemies and burn everything to cinders.   


* **Timecontrol Mage**

A healer spec, using staff, manipulating time to bring his allies back to a previous, more healthy state, move allies out of danger, freeze time to stop damage on allies, and speed time to buff ally's abilities.  


* **Fighter Warrior**

A slow, brute force, melee dps / tank spec using fist weapons to beat down its opponents, getting huge power from Avatar and charging powerfull melee attacks. 

&#x200B;

So these were my ideas on things i want to see on the next expansion. Please post your thoughts, as well as, things you would like to see.

2164,Powercleaving Island Expeditions as an Unholy DK (Guide by Powelifter Doomblade),"Hello! Do you like big numbers?

The current tier of World of Wawa has great things going for it in terms of Unholy Deathknight that I don't see touched on too often here.

Just a brief introduction- I am Doomblade of Kilrogg ([https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveWoW/comments/d85s6e/strength\_stat\_maximum\_for\_82\_theorycraft/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveWoW/comments/d85s6e/strength_stat_maximum_for_82_theorycraft/) )

I am a Strength-cap theory-crafter and I love Mythic Island expeditions. My goal by the end of this guide is to spark this same love in hearts of all you fellow Deathknights.

To start out, this cleaving technique requires 3 armor pieces that have the \[Festermight\] ring on them. It is almost always worth an ilevel downgrade just to secure a third Festermight, rather than 1 or 2. (for raiding? probably not. For big damage Island Expeditions? Oooyeah.)

\[Festermight\]: (Bursting a Festering Wound Grants you 140 Strength for 20 sec. Stacking. Stacking this effect does not extend its duration. (ID: 274081)

What does the end result look like when Unholy? [https://i.imgur.com/aoq3rx6.png](https://i.imgur.com/aoq3rx6.png) ... Not to say Gathering and rabbit charming is a bad method- I just love playing WoW like a Diablo 3 rift.

For Talents, we need to be taking \[Infected Claws\] \[Bursting Sores\] \[Grip of the Dead\] \[Pestilent Pustules\] \[Spell eater\] \[Pestilence\] \[Unholy Frenzy\]

For Heart of Azeroth Essences, take Primary ability \[Condensed Life-Force\] and secondary ability \[Memory of Lucid Dreams\]. If you have the third minor unlocked, fill it with \[Worldvein Resonance\]

Starting off the Mythic Island Expedition, plan a route around camps of various sizes. You want to utilize On a Pale Horse to speed past camps on your mount before they have the opportunity to strike and daze you. On that topic, it is never recommended to run through Amalgamated Ice/Water elementals, as the Frost Bolt Volley they cast will get you cornered and killed.

Things to note while picking up mobs in this fashion is that low HP targets like small wolves and rams are fantastic to agro because \[Infected Claws\] (and by extension, the transformed Ghoul's Rake ability) have a chance to proc more and more wounds per swipe in the dense mob packs. Attempt to gather 2-3 high profile targets (be they Etins, Giants, or Marshmallow Giants.) amongst the lesser creatures.

For each large target you tag agro on, it is recommended that you label them with a raid-marker, a Star, Square and Moon are my go-to. This is valuable for gauging the movement of the high profile targets, as they often move slower than the smaller targets.

The Taffy-pull is a good technique to practice. Running laps around slower targets to decrease the distance between them and the slower enemies. It helps the effectiveness of the next part.

Once you have gathered a third of the island's lumbering animosity, you will want to secure yourself in a Line-of-sight block. (try inside a cave, or inside of the temple.) This might seem counter-intuitive as you lower your chance to evade telegraphed attacks, but it is more often the caster NPCs shooting you from afar that will be your downfall, rather than the melee enemies. You have a good 7 seconds to gain your footing before the hellstorm approaches.

1.) Tag two of the mid-high size enemies with Festering Strike (3-4 seconds before combat)

2.) Drop Army of the Dead to try to mitigate as much agro as possible in the first seconds of the battle.

3.) You need to use 3 abilities to survive. {Icebound Fortitude}, {Anti-Magic Shell}, {Death's Advance}.

4.) Drop Death and Decay in the highest concentration of the enemies. (Aided by the slow of \[Grip of the Dead\], it will buy you a valuable few seconds.

5.) Use your Buff macro, (for me, Blood Fury(ORC) + Unholy Frenzy)

6.) Use Unholy Transformation on your Ghoul

7.) Plant yourself inside the Death and Decay. Your ticking {Death's Advance} will prevent the enemy from knocking you out of it. By this time (1-2 global seconds, the enemy herd will be infected with enough Wounds to secure victory with.

8.) Hit the closest target(inside the death and decay) with Scourge Strike 3-4 times. Your health might be in jeopardy here, cast the empowered Deathstrike as needed to stay alive. Keep Outbreak up on the enemies, Festering strike into Apocalypse on heavy targets. \[Abyssal Healing Potion\] \[Healthstone\] as a last resort.

9.) By this time, you might have close to the maximum of 30 Festermight stacks needed to transform you from Yamcha into Goku.

10.) Deathcoil when empowered, and Festering strike and Scourge Strike anything that is left. A good pull will net you 3-5k azerite points and leave the chests and bags exposed for your gathering allies.

11.) Take it easy on next pull, only your Magic shell and Death's advance will be up. 40-60% of previous pull is a good measure.

[https://youtu.be/q76cfdk0Gwg](https://youtu.be/q76cfdk0Gwg) Video Sample of a failed pull and my allies bailing me out :D

[https://youtu.be/TVmyENWi2Hs](https://youtu.be/TVmyENWi2Hs) Video sample of A Muskflank Bull ruining my whole career by increasing my damage taken by 100%

For bonus points, before the Deathbattle phase, flash 1-2 seconds of Azshara's Font of Power (Trinket) followed by a Potion of Empowered Proximity before Vial of Animated Blood (trinket) is usable. Might as well try to break the Strength record of 32,120 while you are cleaving.

5.) Use your Buff macro, (for me, Blood Fury(ORC) + Unholy Frenzy)

6.) Use Unholy Transformation on your Ghoul

7.) Plant yourself inside the Death and Decay. Your ticking {Death's Advance} will prevent the enemy from knocking you out of it. By this time (1-2 global seconds, the enemy herd will be infected with enough Wounds to secure victory with.

8.) Hit the closest target(inside the death and decay) with Scourge Strike 3-4 times. Your health might be in jeopardy here, cast the empowered Deathstrike as needed to stay alive. Keep Outbreak up on the enemies, Festering strike into Apocalypse on heavy targets. \[Abyssal Healing Potion\] \[Healthstone\] as a last resort.

9.) By this time, you might have close to the maximum of 30 Festermight stacks needed to transform you from Yamcha into Goku.

10.) Deathcoil when empowered, and Festering strike and Scourge Strike anything that is left. A good pull will net you 3-5k azerite points and leave the chests and bags exposed for your gathering allies.

11.) Take it easy on next pull, only your Magic shell and Death's advance will be up. 40-60% of previous pull is a good measure.

For bonus points, before the Deathbattle phase, flash 1-2 seconds of Azshara's Font of Power (Trinket) followed by a Potion of Empowered Proximity before Vial of Animated Blood (trinket) is usable. Might as well try to break the Strength record of 32,120 while you are cleaving.

I'm assuming the facial mechanizations are tied to a layer that helmets are set to cover even when it's unintuitive, something like facial hair or whatnot. I think a lot of players would rather have clipping than have their customizations disappear.

I love the mechanization with the metal jaw, for instance, the one that also gives the eyes with the cool targeting animation.

Blizzard, please consider being more lenient with facial mechanization options, especially considering nothing shows up on mechagnome arms or legs (I'd also think it would be really neat if the 3d geometry of armor, but not the texture, showed up on mechagnome arms and legs too, but that's a story for another day).

Father of Sleep is clearly N'zoth, he must do something really bad before we defeat him.

I'm not sure about the ""golden one"" and the only vacant thrones are for the Warchief and Forsaken (EDIT: its probably Calia Menethil and the Throne of Lordaeron) 

The mistress and her nine ravens, has to be Sylvanas and her remaining Dark Rangers hunting for something.

The vassal of life is either a druid or a dragon that goes bad?  The green eyes could be natural..or from jealousy ?

Five lanterns...I got nothing.

The blind queen and her scepter...Sylvanas again..or maybe Azshara.

The last one sounds cool but I'm drawing a blank, but it sounds like these ""cunning ones"" are just using the six masters.

Father of Sleep is clearly N'zoth, he must do something really bad before we defeat him.

I'm not sure about the ""golden one"" and the only vacant thrones are for the Warchief and Forsaken (EDIT: its probably Calia Menethil and the Throne of Lordaeron) 

The mistress and her nine ravens, has to be Sylvanas and her remaining Dark Rangers hunting for something.

The vassal of life is either a druid or a dragon that goes bad?  The green eyes could be natural..or from jealousy ?

Five lanterns...I got nothing.

The blind queen and her scepter...Sylvanas again..or maybe Azshara.

The last one sounds cool but I'm drawing a blank, but it sounds like these ""cunning ones"" are just using the six masters.

2230,Mechagnomes are a garbage race (especially with so many better options around),"It's really that simple. It's a stupid fucking excuse for an ""allied race"", it *barely* qualified as a faction. They're literally ""Gnome amputees: The Race"".

Is this *really* the best Blizzard could come up with?

I mean, I suppose it's abundantly clear that Blizzard is half-assing anything related to the Alliance (credit where credit is due; Kul Tiras is a good zone). I mean hell, even if you were hellbent against Vrykul, you could have done Gnolls (modified Worgen model) or Furbolg (modified Pandaren?).

My personal pick would've been perhaps a small band of ""reformed"" K'thir, who are basically the Illithid/C'thulu looking dudes in Stormsong Valley, who use the Forsaken model. If you made them stand upright (and perhaps even *float* for running/walking?), I think they'd have been genuinely *very* interesting.

Admittedly, I'd probably shrink their heads a bit compared to the existing models, and obviously have some cosmetic options (different types of tentacles, maybe braided designs, various aquatic-inspired skin colors, maybe even glowing bio-luminescent ""tattoos""), they'd have actually *brought* something to the mix.

Fucking *Mechagnomes*, though?

2238,Question about race unlocking and faction changes,"Hi, like many people, I'm really excited about the Vulpera race being available in the near future. The thing is, I've always played Alliance (only dabbled with Horde, mainly because I couldn't find a race/class combo that spoke to me). I very much want to play a Vulpera though. I'm wondering if there is a shortcut to being able to unlock the race when it comes time. Would I be able to faction change one of my Alliance characters to Horde, and by doing that have the exalted with the Voldunai you need to then do the race unlocking quest chain? And then, would I be able to faction change my main character back to Alliance afterward without losing anything (both to that character, and also not losing the vulpera unlock?). 

Thanks for any advice. If doing a workaround to do this has too many negatives, I'll just go play the one Horde character I tried to get into for a while but couldn't, and do it the old fashioned way.

2246,[8.3 Spoilers] New Whispers from [Spoiler],"8.3 sees the return of **Il'gynoth**, who has several new whispers for us to go crazy over:

> Before the last shadow falls, the Father of Sleep shall savor his feast.

This seems to be a clear reference to Mueh'zala, who is known as the Father of Sleep. Its been believed that he may be Bwonsamdi's ""boss"" and the one Odyn made a deal with. It has been speculated he is the death entity that Sylvanas has been serving. The ""feast"" seems to imply this as she used the war to feed the ""hungering darkneess"".

> The golden one claims a vacant throne. The crown of light will bring only darkness

Seems to be a reference to Anduin claiming his father's throne? Though arguably also could refer to Arthas (albeit, he is dead).

edit: /u/Will1707 makes a good point that the empty throne could be the Forsaken/Lordaeron. Calia would also fit this perfectly. 

> When their mistress beckons, nine ravens take flight. Each seeks a prize to earn her favor.

/u/Kromgar and /u/tiniestjazzhands  have pointed out that the nine ravens could be Sylvanas' Nine Valk'yr, which could return thanks to whatever Bargain she made. 

Also ""The Lord of Ravens will turn the Key"". Sylvanas is responsible for releasing N'zoth through her bargain with Aszhara and leading us to Nazjatar!

> The vassal of life disguises treachery. Beware the eyes of green.

Green Dragonflight perhaps? I wonder if they are now building to a Life-God that is more powerful than the Wild Gods (Elune?). 

> Five lanterns, now darkened. The flame they seek will light the masters' way.

Honestly every reference to the torches that will light the way have made me more uncertain/unsure. 

> The blind queen wields a scepter of bone. From the deep she calls forth doom.

Sylvanas maybe? Calling forth death? 

> The cunning ones kneel before six masters, but serve only one.

Here are some of the things that I witnessed:

* People ninja-looting in dungeons. I really miss the modern system of personal loot.
* People ninja-skinning devilsaurs that someone else killed.
* A guild mate declaring ""item x reserved"" when posting on LFG, or even later, when you enter the dungeon.
* The guild's loot council finds creative, inconsistent and ""flexible"" reasoning to grant loot to the guild master, the officers or their closest friends. One time it's ""we're giving priority to those who get the tier set bonus"", one time it's the exact opposite.
* People needing on non-upgrade weapons that they're clearly going to vendor, just for the 5 gold. EDIT: a few hours after this post, the guild master (warrior) needed on a 6g caster dagger ""to practice his dagger skill"". As if you can't do that with a 2 silver dagger from a vendor.
* Guild mates inviting you to BRD, and only after you start - you discover they're JUST farming the one boss that drops Hand of Justice repeatedly, and refuse to do any other boss that drops loot you want.
* Guildies constantly making jokes about one hunter's DPS, threatening to remove his rights to talk on guild chat till he improves. That hunter has raided with us since day 1 and had perfect attendance. He seems like a nice guy. I don't know if this is a real issue or a joke, but it feels like bullying.
* People constantly talking about epixxxx on Discord nonstop, no other topic whatsoever. They use automated addons to skip all quest text, and do not care about any story elements like I do. Unlike modern WoW, Classic has no cinematics to deliver story - so if they're not readers, they can shut out this entire part of the game.

N'Zoth separated Xal'atath from the Black Blade and deliberately left it so it could be taken by Horde adventurers which would then lead them to delivering it to Sylvanas. Furthermore, N'Zoth proclaimed that it must be left to serve its will. This could mean that N'Zoth is not so gullible to believe Azshara is a faithful servant and knew what would happen but have the Black Blade to serve another purpose that we don't know about.

2258,Unlocking the allied races: one faction is getting screwed over,"**Here's the dilemma:**

If Rustbolt Resistance rep is account wide then Horde players will be able to obtain both allied races simply from playing through the storyline, whereas Alliance will have to go out of there way to get Voldunai rep on a Horde toon.

If Rustbolt Resistance rep ISN'T account wide then Horde players will have to play through Mechagon again in it's entirety.

**Referring to the past:**

In legion both factions had the same reputations which made it easy to do the leg-work on Horde and unlock the Alliance allied races and vice versa.

So far in BFA it hasn't been that easy. With every Horde BFA reputation exalted - if you want Kul'Tiran/Dark Iron Dwarf - you still have to get Proudmoore and 7th legion reputation to exalted on an alliance toon.

The only way they could strike a balance would be to make Voldunai rep coincide with an alliance rep such as Order of Embers... That would be a really strange move on their part considering they had the option to do that earlier in the expansion and chose not to. What do you think?

**TLDR:**

Are the Mechagnome requirements account wide? If so than what about Vulpera? Will Alliance have more work to do or will Horde have to repeat Mechagon?",1570526051.0,"Unlocking the allied races: one faction is getting screwed over**Here's the dilemma:**

2267,How to fix the Worgen Heritage Armor (And why it won't be as hard as it sounds),"##So as I'm sure you've already seen, [the Worgen Heritage Armor came out today](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/873482.jpg), and the reception has been less than warm. 

Obviously the set isn't perfect, but I also think it's not as bad as people have been saying. I've been listening to (and participating in) arguments about the outfit since it was announced, and the four biggest issues people seem to have with it are as follows. 

* **The set isn't sufficiently savage, and should be a closer match to Genn's armor.**

* **The set feels painted-on, like quest greens.**

* **The coat is too short.** 

* **The gold is too bright.**

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

For starters, lets discuss where the developers got their inspiration for the set. Looking at the design of the cuffs/shoulders/shawl, [I am 99% sure their main influence came from this HOTS Skin](https://i.redd.it/u0x0jn8qa6r31.jpg), with elements of [Genn's Blue and Gold armor like the boots mixed in.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/12/ae/0f/12ae0fe937e76e6b06702474da57c20a.jpg) Let's compare these to [a screenshot of the armor as it appears without top hat and shoulders](https://i.imgur.com/khZkvTm.jpg). 

They actually share similar designs, so why does Genns outfit look more striking?

##Short answer. It's longer.

Genns armor stretches all the way to his boots, creating a more unified feel that makes it look more like he's wearing a heavy battle coat, and not a dinner suit. Luckily there are two ways to fix this!

The first (and more difficult) is to **lengthen the coat** so that it goes down further on the players legs. This will make the midsection feel more developed and help the set feel finished. However, as we've seen with the Kul-Tiran longcoat, this leads to clipping issues and is difficult to model. Luckily, there's an even better solution.

##**Give the set a cloak**

[Take a look at Genns armor again.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/12/ae/0f/12ae0fe937e76e6b06702474da57c20a.jpg), the tunic isn't actually that long, but it has a second piece that wraps around the back of the set and goes down to his boots. This would be the perfect implementation of a special back piece that adds both a high collar that meshes into the existing chestpiece, and a wraparound cape that starts underneath the arms before tapering back into a typical split cloak at the bottom. This would make the outfit feel both heavier, and more savage/battle ready. While still giving players who want a fancier outfit the option to leave the cloak off and use the set we have currently. 

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

##**Other simple improvement.**

There are a few other changes that would help the outfit feel more 3D, so the armor feels as unique as a heritage set should.

* Add buckles to the boots. This would make them look more distinct when on a transformed worgen.

* Add items like a pistol to the belt, to help the waist feel less tiny. 

* [Darken the gold to something closer to this/incorporate more brown.](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8f64d542335ae80a8faff5a5b2fef58a/tumblr_pz0vmx6N8n1yw3awdo1_540.gifv)

* Add a second pair of gloves closer to the ones Genn wears in-game that override the cuffs if chosen. 

* Add an invisible fist weapon so melee classes can use their claws in combat. 

* Make the gloves stop at the wrists (Right now they're bugged and cover the set wrists).

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

##**One final change.**

A big part of this heritage questline is to help develop the class fantasy of the Worgen, and what it means to balance rage and peace. With that, why not allow the heritage questline to unlock a toggleable ability that allows us to auto-transform into human form when not in combat, like Genn Greymane has done for years. While this isn't distinctly an armor change, now would be the perfect time to implement it, and it would do a lot to improve the Worgen Class Fantasy.",1570524383.0,"How to fix the Worgen Heritage Armor (And why it won't be as hard as it sounds)##So as I'm sure you've already seen, [the Worgen Heritage Armor came out today](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/873482.jpg), and the reception has been less than warm.

Now you have to mind sear every at least 30 sec in order for your insanity to not drop, and it just gets really tiresome to keep it up if they're discussing tactics or the like, and you don't wanna say fuck it and drop it, cause then you have to reset boss again.

So i was thinking that i could just get an auto clicker to click every 20 seconds or something and just mouse it over mind sear while i wait, but i heard that some times you can get banned if you do regular millisecond precise inputs for long intervals, but i have a hard time seeing this as being bannable, but does anyone know if it is against TOS and or bannable, or how i can contact blizz to ask, cause there wasn't a good option for a ticket to send in.",1570521018.0,"Is using an autoclicker out of combat bannable?So with the recent changes in 8.2.5 made it so you couldn't as easily get insanity outside of combat as Spriest, which has caused many spriests, like myself (or actually an alt, but i play it for some mythic progress fights), to get insanity by either pulling boss and resetting or spamming shadow crash, but then mind sear in order for it to not drop.

**Tyrande, conspicuously absent from the Fourth War in Patch 8.2.5, has returned with some opinions on the end of the War Campaign. Story spoilers.**

**As expected, Tyrande is upset by the events of the Fourth War, as Sylvanas has escaped and she still wants vengeance for Teldrassil--as well as the curious matter of Elune abandoning the Night Elves.**

**We also learn that the Horde is now run by a council, including Baine and Thrall, instead of a singular Warchief.**

Anduin: The armistice is signed. At long last, the Fourth War is over.

Tyrande: No. Not while the Black Moon still cries out for vengeance. Not until the Horde has answered for its treachery.

Anduin: Further bloodshed will not bring back the fallen. We must renew our hope and forge a future for those who survived.

Tyrande: And when the next warchief musters an army, will hope save you if it is Stormwind that burns?

Anduin: I know it's difficult to trust, but there are signs of change within the Horde. In place of a warchief, there is now a council led by Baine, Thrall, and the others. I believe they can--

Tyrande: Your faith is naive, lion son. I will sign no treaty unless it is written in the Banshee's blood!

Anduin: Tyrande!

Genn: There is truth in her words, Anduin. Peace may be on the table today, but soon enough the Horde will sound their drums and march for war.

Genn: When that day comes, no scrap of parchment will hold them back.

Anduin: The path to peace will not be easy, and not all will choose to walk it. But this is the only way to build a better future. I believe it will work, Genn.

&#x200B;

*Tyrande also has a conversation with Shandris!*

&#x200B;

Shandris: You spoke harshly to King Anduin, Tyrande. The kaldorei can ill afford to shun the Alliance. They have provided aid and comfort to us in these dark times.

Tyrande: The young king is foolish to trust our enemies. Harsh words should be the least of his fears.

Shandris: The Banshee Queen no longer leads the Horde. Those who do seem more inclined toward peace than war.

Tyrande: If the wolf is rabid, it matters not who rides it. Sooner or later, the beast will bare its fangs.

Shandris: You are dearest to my heart, Tyrande. I beg you, let go of the Black Moon's rage and embrace the mother's light once again. I could not bear to lose you to darkness.

Tyrande: Know this. My hunger for vengeance will not be sated so long as Sylvanas Windrunner remains free--and until I know why Elune abandoned her children.

Shandris: Tyrande! Do not say such--

Tyrande: I will tarry no longer in this city of men. Let us leave for the boughs of Nordrassil.

Tyrande: From there we will dispatch the Sentinels to every corner of Azeroth. Let no one rest until the Banshee is found!

2315,Patch 8.3: Essences and Alts,"First off, I'm very excited about 8.3. It looks promising in a number of ways. I'm glad Blizzard seems to want to end BFA on a high note, rather than just cut their losses and make the next batch of content a new Expansion. (Veil of Eternal Blossoms is back!!!) 

For people's Mains, the new stuff looks great, the new Essence slot and Essences have piqued my interests. And hell, for a single Character, maybe even 2, the system works very well. It makes you feel invested in your Character and the additional customization that Essences provide feel engaging. 

However. One of the issues that Ion didn't bring up are Essences and Alts. If anything, it feels like 8.3 will actually make the situation worse since there will be 1 more slot and more Essences to grind out. I myself have a couple of 120's that are just in mothballs because so much of their power is tied to Essences. I have 3 Characters fully kitted out and just shelved every other one because I despised grinding them out even a 3rd time.

What do people think of the state of Essences as they relate to Alts? Did Ion simply not include changes to the system for 8.3 that actually made it to the PTR?

2331,The best way to Fix the issues with the Worgen Heritage Armor.,"[Blizzard Version of the Worgen Heritage Armor](https://i.redd.it/nbaedihc87r31.jpg)

So I've noticed an immediate issue with the Worgen Heritage armor (beyond it looking very two dimensional) it's too pristine.

In Lore the Worgen were cursed to have this horrible affliction that destroyed them as a person and made them into mindless feral monsters. This armor doesn't reflect any of that trauma. The Worgen are very unique as a race being the only race to be able to willingly transform between Human and ""Werewolf"" form. If the Design team took this approach and decided to really go into that dual forms aspect of the race i think they'd have found a lot more success.

How i'd fix it:Personally i think its an aesthetic issue here rather than a flat poly issue. I'd suggest keeping the armor as is as a Worgen in their human form, but when they transform it takes on another appearance. I'd suggest that the clothes rip around the seams. The shoes are destroyed at the toe since the clawed feet protrude through the leather, the claws rip through the leather of their gloves, chest and pants bulge and tear as the larger more beastly form makes space for the muscle that make the Worgen truly terrifying. The pauldrons would be great with a bite or a claw mark in them as well, as if the Worgen player mid transformation had bit into or tried to paw it off. The hat in itself doesn't NEED to change but aesthetics are the point here so i'd say have it be slightly off-center maybe over one ear, potentially crushed down a bit to resemble if it had been cast off and stepped on during the transformation.

I think this would add a lot to the Worgen having their dual forms as well as having a Heritage Set that reflects their unique (Victorian Style) Heritage.

TLDR: 2 forms of heritage armor Human: intact -- Worgen: ripped/destroyed but still functional.

I look forward to hearing your input.(Please no screaming about the current state of WoW no one wants to hear that nonsense)",1570517898.0,"The best way to Fix the issues with the Worgen Heritage Armor.[Blizzard Version of the Worgen Heritage Armor](https://i.redd.it/nbaedihc87r31.jpg)

But the set left me so disappointed that I decided to came here just to write this as a way to release some steam, so sorry if I do annoy someone.

As always, english is my second language so sorry for typos

So, during this expansion I been maining my worgen and I been struggling to make a good transmog for it, I look forward to each new patch to see what new pieces i could find to play with, but while I been making some sets that had been ok at best, I been struggling a lot to find a good set for my worgen I been spent so much time using.

The remodels left me satisfied for the most part and when I heard about the heritage set, i was eager to see what they would make, and seeing the thing got delayed had me hoping for something cool. Not only I was eager to see the set, i was in need for a cool set for transmog.

After all that, we got a low res top hat that clips with the wogerns hair and ears, a flower that is just a flat texture, and something that only needs a bow tie to be a formal outfit with shoulder pads. Ugh, not only the thing looks ugly, it has CERO versatility, maybe once i have it in my hands things may change, but the thing seen to have no room to play with, there're SO MANY THINGS the could had done, like maybe turn the feet parts into something more than just ankle bracers, or a belt with actual stuff rather than another flat texture, or a fucking long coat at least like the the one of the Kul Tiras, and i wouldn't be mad if it wasn't that the goblin set is ten times better. FUCK, I don't want to be one of those pessimist guys but this thing is genuinely making me mad.

Now, I do want to point out that this is not ""the worst thing in wow history or something"" or that I may go ranting about quitting the game or something, as I said before, this is just me venting out my frustration even if its for something so petty. I wish to have a way to convince blizz to change this, heck, I wouldn't mind to delay this set a month or two while goblins get their set now. I know this is something really small, but for some people who love their characters and their lore, this can feel a bit personal.

FUCK, I don't want to be one of those pessimist guys but this thing is genuinely making me mad.

Now, I do want to point out that this is not ""the worst thing in wow history or something"" or that I may go ranting about quitting the game or something, as I said before, this is just me venting out my frustration even if its for something so petty. I wish to have a way to convince blizz to change this, heck, I wouldn't mind to delay this set a month or two while goblins get their set now. I know this is something really small, but for some people who love their characters and their lore, this can feel a bit personal.

For those who took their time to read this, thank you, I appreciate any comment.",1

2362,The Importance of Mage Tower-like Content in Retail,"In Legion many people have suggested that Mage Tower should have been a static challenge where your gear wouldn't affect the difficulty of it. For instance, Agatha was almost impossible for an undergeared character and became trivial if you overgeared it which made the challenge not so interesting.

While it's good for the Mage Tower itself to gear-lock the content, it's bad for the rest of the game. Mage Tower gave you a reason to gear up your character which made gear progression relevant.

While others might have reasons of their own to get better gear, I lack the motivation for it in 8.2. I don't Mythic raid or push high keys so what's the purpose of Normal/Heroic raids for people like me aka. the majority of the playerbase ? Even for a Mythic raider, gearing up is a group effort to clear the raid and serves no other purpose. You don't personally gain anything by getting better gear unless your guild gears up alongside you.

Depending on the rewards, Horrific Visions in 8.3 is supposed to fulfil the role of Mage Tower and I'm looking forward to it. The best part about it is that there won't be an 8.4 with catch-up gear which would've destroyed the gear progression like 7.3 did for mage tower. 

Another beauty of the mage tower is that after you got to a certain gear level, a time gate didn't feel like a time gate. You know if you played perfectly you could've beaten the challenge so it made you look forward to the next reset. Without that content, time gating only frustrates the player because they have to wait for no reason. If horrific visions is challenging enough then it's going to be a more natural time gated content, rather than indirectly telling people ""you have to wait because we want more sub money"".

Lastly if the azerite/essence grind in 8.3 isn't obnoxious, playing alts is going to be more enjoyable as we're going to have a goal to reach in the end.",1570515587.0,"The Importance of Mage Tower-like Content in RetailIn Legion many people have suggested that Mage Tower should have been a static challenge where your gear wouldn't affect the difficulty of it.

2502,The Worgen Heritage Armour: I'm both disappointed and angry.,"If you're reading this, then by now I'm sure you've seen the worgen heritage armour, and I know I'm not alone in saying that quite frankly, it's a big letdown. 

This was blizzard's chance to make something that looked really good on worgen, something many past sets have struggled with due to the race's particular anatomy, but they blew it. The top hat, while somewhat dapper, still looks silly just doesn't quite sit right on their head.

The chest section, and the set overall, looks somewhat better on female worgen, but on male worgen, it might as well not be there for how flat and plain it is.

The lower coat section on the legs is similarly underwhelming on male worgen, and really should be much longer. The belt is so thin and unimpressive it's hard to notice, and the gold shoulder pads just look tacky.

For a supposed heritage ""armour"", it doesn't at all look like something anyone would wear into battle. Genn's in-game armour looks far better, along with his model in Heroes of the Storm.

I accept that at this point it's probably too late for much at all, if anything at all, to be changed, but I personally would be fine with a longer delay to facilitate a total redesign. After how long it's been since we had any real story development for Gileans and the worgen, and how long it took for them to give us a much needed model update, worgen really deserved better.

TL;DR, the heritage armour is rather crap, they really could've done so much better, and I'm disappointed.

* Only in english.
* It's running on some free hosting so it might broke or be slow at 1st loading if the hosting has gone idle + I don't expect that much success but Blizzard API calls aren't cached or stuff so Blizzard quotas might pause the site on hourly basis. Don't hesitate to ping me if there's issues.

2595,What can I do for grinding Zandalari Empire rep & Direhorn question,"Hey,

I've tried to watch videos, checked wowhead, but I feel like I am missing something here. I bought Contract: Zandalari Empire, which gives you ""bonus"" (these 10 rep bonuses driving me crazy) and I do WQ every day + doing emissary, but I got only 4 since I hit 120 (more than a month), missions on the boat - usually only for 125 rep + 100 rep as a bonus (5 times in total) and I really don't know what I can do more. I like their race, I fell in love with them since I was leveling in BfA, but this make me feel burnt out completely. I read about doing island expedition, where I'd get a CHANCE to get something to trade for a rep, but it seems like a small chance with not that much to get from it. What can I do? I get daily maybe 500-1000 rep and that means it can be another month, but I am starting to be very annoyed about this. They could give us more content for grinding that rep - like HB where I didn't know how and I hit honored, revered and now I have 17k/21k revered with nice content and not even finished whole updated War Campaign...

&#x200B;

The second questions is about that achievement - How to train your Direhorn. I got first 3 points as progress with this achievement, but now I have Direhorn with fully charged XP bar and nothing happened. Now, should I wait for a message? Or should I do something?

# FAQ

- **Will it be kept up to date ?**

Probably.

- **What are those last two tabs ?**

Don't ever touch that. It's used to generate dropdown lists, and keep currency icons links in one place so I can reference them more efficiently.

- **There's a lot of items that are missing !**

I only included collection-related items, so appearances and stuff you learn and that disappear from your bags. Things like [Checkered Flag](https://www.wowhead.com/item=122128) or the [Darkmoon ""Sword""](https://www.wowhead.com/item=77256) aren't included because they take bag space and have a limited number of uses and can't be transmogged and should really be toys/cosmetic but they aren't c'mon Blizz.

- **Why is the thing already filled ?**

Because I'd rather keep up to date one sheet with my progression, and ask you to take 5 mn to clear it and fill yours, than maintain two separate sheets with no way to conveniently copy changes from one to the other. Also, it makes a pretty nice preview of what it looks like.

- **My sheet isn't updated with <new patch> ?**

Because the copies you made of my sheet aren't instances of that sheet, but fully independant sheets that happen to be exacly the same as mine with no links to mine whatsoever. If I update mine, yours isn't going to be updated. You'll have to do it yourself (and it's not that complicated, honestly).

- **It's missing <specific thing> !**

Alright, [send me a message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=ZeShmoutt&subject=WoW+Darkmoon+Faire+Collection+sheet+stuff) and I'll see what I can do. Or I'll send you a message back with verbose insults and a explanation why I didn't include <specific thing> and that you can add it yourself to your sheet if you want.

- **Can I modify it ?**

Well, as explained before, as soon as you copy it, it becomes an independant sheet. Therefore, yes, you can modify your own independant sheet. At your own risk, of course - I don't do tech support.

- **But y tho?**

[I like making fancy spreadsheets.](/u/ZeShmoutt/comments/b09xn1) That's all.

Maybe I'll aso make a standalone app version with Unity that will also work on Android and connect to your B.net account and updates itself and everything.

Maybe not.

I know I'm not supposed to kink shame people because freedom of expression and whatever, but you're making it hard, you know ?

2607,Quick question regarding AutoHotkey,"I know that AutoHotkey  is technically a grey area but from my understanding no one has been banned for it without doing something they shouldn't be. I've been using it for the past 7 years now without any issues, but I've only ever used it to change which monitor the game is displayed on.

Today I found `/run Sound_GameSystem_RestartSoundSystem()`, which refreshes the default sound driver without restarting the game. I'd like to tie this into my AutoHotkey  script, but I'm worried about the whole ""one press one action"" thing since I don't know if that only applies to in game. I made a macro that runs the above command and it launches via the same button I use to run my AutoHotkey script to change the default audio my computer uses. To simplify, one click preforms an in game function (numpad  multiplication key) and also runs a completely out of game windows command to change the default audio device.

2610,As a new player I like and hate the rep grind to obtain flying,"Hi all,  


I started playing wow about three months ago. I hit 120 two months ago and started working on the rep grind for bfa the moment i hit max. Today i completed the pathfinder part 2 for bfa. I liked the experience of doing the grind without flying I think its a good thing to have to go through the content without the ability to just fly from point a to point b. It lets me experience the game in a different way.

I started playing wow about three months ago. I hit 120 two months ago and started working on the rep grind for bfa the moment i hit max. Today i completed the pathfinder part 2 for bfa. I liked the experience of doing the grind without flying I think its a good thing to have to go through the content without the ability to just fly from point a to point b. It lets me experience the game in a different way.

2613,Tankiness of DPS classes,"Currently I'm playing with DH, but only because it's so comfortable in outdoor content even in a ""simple"" (unupgraded) benthic gear: you can just wrap up a big amount of mobs and AoE them down. Or hey, that's an elite? No problem, you can just solo it.
But honestly I don't like the theme or the playstyle of a DH. So I tried to search for other classes, but I'm not sure which one. Retribution paladin seemed like a no brainer, but to my suprise it's nowhere near DH level of tankiness. Sure, it can heal itself, but only if you sacrafice your dps which usually means long and boring fights (sometimes saved by some random people). I also don't like doing outdoor content as a tank, because again, while you are really tanky (of course), the rotation and burstyness of a tank is nowhere to a dps.
So is there any other **DPS spec** which tankiness and survivability is similar to the DH? Preferably not relying on a pet for tanking, because pets are not the best for rounding up the mobs and they can be really annoying in outdoor content navigating the terrain (and in the past they had some lag on dismounting, which felt clunky, not sure if that still happens).

\- I've changed the input/output devices for both discord and WoW.

Is my iLvl too low or is enhancement just bad at taking damage? Or do I just suck? lol any advice would be appreciated.

Edit: Seems like my iLvl is a bit low as well as enhancement just being in a bad place right now.

2678,Good places to quest or farm mobs for XP at level 57?,"Y'all helped me so much the last two times, i figure I'd bug you once again, and hopefully for the last time!

I just dinged 57, and seem to have run out of yellow quests. (cleared Un'Goro, Felwood, Winterspring, Silithus, WP, EP, Burning Steppes), and the only quests remaining are at 60 and don't turn yellow for me until 58. So at 58 i'm looking pretty, but I'm wondering if I may have missed some quests along the way. I have a quest marker addon so I don't think so, but figure i'd ask. I can also usually only play in 30-45 minute spurts, so dungeons are usually out of the question for me. I've only run a dungeon once in my entire leveling process from 1-57 thus far! 

Am I stuck to grinding mobs for a level? I was thinking the Furlbogs in Winterspring as that works on the rep at the same time, but if someone knows of a better spot that is more XP efficient and has better gold per hour, let me know!

Ideally a place that isn't heavily farmed, doesn't have mobs that are hard to kill, but also still provide good XP and drops.

2681,Thank you stranger,"Quick background: I came back to classic for the nostalgia after years away, and my fianc√© decided she would play retail... she‚Äôs never played WoW before, and enjoys the QoL changes of retails vs. classic. She‚Äôs been playing for a little bit, but today, someone absolutely made her day though.

She was doing another character (she never goes past 20 because she keeps trying new classes), and she got a quest to go to the Darkmoon Fair. She was so excited, she is a night elf today and started her journey and the fair really peaked her interest. Well she gets going and almost always gets lost very easily in the world. She finally gets to SW but can‚Äôt figure out where to go, so she goes to general chat.....

Some kind stranger not only invited her to a group to show her, but he also got out his 2 seater rocket mount, and flew her there. She couldn‚Äôt figure out how to get on, but he was extremely kind and patient.  When they landed, he opened trade and he gave her some gold, with the words ‚Äúspend it wisely, and have fun!‚Äù. She screamed with excitement (which is when I became aware of what was going on lol). She was more excited than I can put into words y‚Äôall... it was like a kid on Christmas hah. She went on to enjoy the fair, and all day she keeps saying ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe that happened‚Äù.... she may struggle but this experience has totally changed her perspective on this game... thank you stranger.

Just make sure you run the script you already downloaded to uninstall the old one before you download and apply the new workaround.

I've written a little script that will automatically apply a workaround to stop the game from freezing up when you turn in quests and complete dungeons.

The script creates a small backup of the permissions it changes before applying them, that way you can undo the changes it causes. Keep in mind that the Battle.net launcher will also undo the changes, so if you want to keep the game 'fixed', you'll have to manually launch it by running the Wow.exe file in your World of Warcraft\\\_retail\_ folder (The script will tell you where to find that file after you run it the first time.

In the midst of people regularly complaining about things or saying classic is better for x reason, there are obviously lots of people still playing retail, so I want to hear what you love about wow right now because I believe there definitely are things you adore.

also i dont seem to be able to find my old bags on the AH , i have 4 embersilk bags but i couldnt find any of those , why is that ?  ( wanted to buy 3 more for the bank ) but i couldnt find any so i got neatherweave bags instead since its only 18 slots i am losing in the bank , and they are  cheap

2771,Question about party sync - what happens when the lowest level party member outlevels a content bracket?,"Hi. I've been looking for an answer for this question since 8.2.5 came out, but I haven't been able to find one!

I am currently playing as a Demon Hunter with my friend, a Paladin. I'm currently level 105 and they are level 25, and we're questing together in the old world 1-60 stuff. I scale down to level 60 thanks to party sync.

However, the party sync article Blizzard put up states that all party member levels will be lowered down to the maximum level of the highest content bracket the lowest level party member is eligible for.

Does this mean that the moment my friend hits level 60 (or possibly even 58), and they become eligible for Outland/Northrend which has a cap of 80, my Demon Hunter's level will jump up to 80?

We're trying very hard not to outlevel content, since we're doing a Loremaster type thing where we're trying to do every quest and instance in the game 'at level' instead of after they go gray and everything gets one-shot which is very boring. 

I literally have spent hours trying to figure this out, to the point of trying to bribe level 61 players to group with me for 30 seconds so I can turn party sync on and see what happens to our levels while in Stormwind or Elwynn, but so far I've gone up to 1000 gold and still nobody will group with me. I really don't want to be surprised by what happens when my friend hits 58/60, so I thought I'd ask here.

So fast forward to last week, my best friend is finally going to try the game. I've been bugging him for 9 years but he finally got into MMOs with FFXIV and now he wants to try WoW. 

I copy the game over like I have dozens of times, fire it up and log in with his account. All good. So I give the laptop back to him. 

Last night he messaged me that his game was doing something weird, so I get in with TeamViewer. His launcher is TRYING TO INSTALL THE GAME AGAIN in program files.

So I'm returning after a long time away, I played a little TBC and that's it(just got to 80? and nothing more).

Well long story short, I came back to classic, played till about 33 with a Druid and tried Retail. The QoL changes in retail is just to much for me to pass up, it's so easy to do dungeons, and I feel my time is much more effectively spent(got Wife, 2 kids and such) 

As I havent really experienced content that much after classic I rolled a DK, as he practically starts where I left off. I'm currently having a blast playing a blood DK, tanking some dungeons I never got to do as a younger player(only 62 so haven't played much) Here's some questions..

Is Blood DK viable for leveling? Or is it faster to go Frost or Unholy?

Does casual guilds exist anymore? My plan is just to go trough the content that is there now, don't think I will care or try to go for high-end competitive raiding as I don't have the time for it at this point. I'm on Tarren Mill EU btw.",1570370887.0,"Returning playerHi!

I noticed in the most recent cutscene  in front of Orgrimmar that the majority of the forsaken were standing holding the forsaken flag. To be this is a heavy symbolism of where the majority of their allegiance lies, not with the horde but with the interests of Sylvanas. 

On the other side of things we have Tyrande and Malfurion that have been nowhere to be seen. Have they forgetten about the world tree or are they going to come back with a vengeance?

Warcraft 3 had 4 races - Humans, Horde, Undead, and Night elves. With the way the story is going I could see them potentially splitting the Night elves and possibly another race off, as well as the forsaken. The divides are all already there - they just need a push.

Blizzard has been talking about the unified one world level 60 level squish. That's along the lines of ESO leveling system, so if they are going that direction and trying a different somewhat successful model, a multi faction system is not too big of a stretch.

I play bfa now and whenever I am on a BG if we lose just one flag for example people start to leave the group . Another example there was a world pvp event in Nazjatar today and we were winning and because we lost one flag 60% of the raid group left ffs.
I see this behavior every time I play. Not only that the instance chat when I play on BG is just trash talking.
What the fuck is going on with horde players nowadays? It seems like all the kids play horde now.
Never played alliance but I‚Äôm considering switching if the community is less toxic.
I‚Äôm sure I gonna get downvoted btw",1

2940,An unresolved WoD plot thread that could tie into the Shadowlands/Death and Wrathion,"With Wrathion making a comeback and all the nods and hints towards Life/Death in BFA, this little unresolved plot thread in WoD could tie in with the next expansion.

In Spires of Arrak we come across Admiral Taylors garrison with all of the inhabitants slaughtered and turned into ghosts, including the Admiral.

One of Taylors men, Ephial, was a Necromancer in disguise and had turned against his men. We go through a series of quests and eventually kill him. Upon killing him he says the following, ""The dark one promised me so much...If I succeeded..."".

Maybe this ""dark one"" is the same ""hungering darkness"" that Sylvanas mentions.

There is also a log that can be found in a garrison chest, named Admiral Taylors Garrison log. The log reveals that Wrathion arrived at the garrison on the 12'th day of the expedition as a fugitive of the Alliance. He was welcomed as a ""guest"", but was to remain under house arrest and guard at the garrison. Shipments arrived at the garrison over the following days as gifts from Wrathion, which helped build an inn. At this time, Taylor asked the guards to maintain a constant watch on Wrathion, but they admitted that Wrathion had paid the guards to keep an eye on Taylor himself. Almost a month into the expedition, Taylor returned to the garrison after a week away to find the garrison in Chaos, Ephial in charge and Wrathion had disappeared, taking several followers with him.",1570334788.0,"An unresolved WoD plot thread that could tie into the Shadowlands/Death and WrathionWith Wrathion making a comeback and all the nods and hints towards Life/Death in BFA, this little unresolved plot thread in WoD could tie in with the next expansion.

She was upset that she couldn't get a mount or trade etc but was having fun playing a game with Mom and Dad.

Well, we upgraded her account (110 boost to play with Mom and Dad) and bought BfA when it was on sale for all of us. She struggled through the initial war scene, but managed it with our assistance. Seeing her fave when Jaina showed up with her boat was awesome. She was so awestruck. And freaking out when the Alliance broke our tank.

Me and the wife did the prison break scenario while she was at school, with the intent to sync with her yesterday afternoon. Unfortunately, life got busy and we werent able to play with her. She decided to hop on and play by herself.

Night Elves and Gnomes both have a problem with facial hair and eyebrows being linked together. If you change facial hair, your eyebrows change as well, and the only non-bearded option shaves off your eyebrows. I am sure a lot of people playing them would love to see that customization separated.

With Worgen, changing their facial hair also changes their ear shape. They also have the additional problem of their two forms being linked together, and their human forms lack options. I know especially RPers would love to have their two forms customizations separated and getting more options in their human forms. Especially hair colors, as you can't make a worgen who's grey-haired in their human form.

3038,"Interactive WoW Classic Map Update #3 (NPC's, Quests, Locations, Nearby)","Hey guys,

Just wanted to share some new features I've just released for my interactive map, keen to hear any feedback good or bad :)

[https://www.gamermaps.net/map/world-of-warcraft/classic](https://www.gamermaps.net/map/world-of-warcraft/classic)

# Quest Search & Info Panels

For those who like to plan offline when access to the game is limited, I've imported all quest data and compiled a panel that shows the quest giver, related npc's and quest completer all with relevant keys that you can identify on the map.

https://i.redd.it/1g5ip2w8soq31.jpg

# Searchable NPC Location Database

Added in over 178,000 NPC's and their locations in the game and plotted them onto the map for your searching pleasure :)  Use the new panel to search for a mob / npc or lookup a trainer, vendor whoever to see their location.  Hogger FTW!

https://i.redd.it/ehm1lzncsoq31.jpg

# Herb & Mining Node Locations

Continuing on from the main reason why I started the map in the first place, the database of located herbs and ores continues to grow and is up to over 11,000 locations.  Covers all herbs, ores across every zone all from a simple little interface.  Show them all if you wish but wait for it to load :)

https://i.redd.it/038jvtrgsoq31.jpg

# Game POI Location Database

Included as part of the NPC database we now hold, I've plotted the location of all useful NPC's (vendors, trainers, quest givers, flight masters, repairers etc), these are all available as a separate toggle just select what you want to see.

https://i.redd.it/897gwagjsoq31.jpg

# Locations

In addition to NPC's I've also plotted many locations from the game world onto the map and added to a searchable interface.

https://i.redd.it/9ph9td1nsoq31.jpg

# Nearby

Added a right click context menu option that shows which npc's, quests, trainers, herbs etc are available around the marked location.

https://i.redd.it/h8lsez1qsoq31.jpg

Think thats all I have to show you for now, I do hope some of you find this useful.

Warlock with 3 different specs that all are unique is awesome for game play and if you know how to play each spec, it's all viable whether you think it is or not. Obviously demo warlock is the best right now for M+ but you can look at other specs and see some things that might work pretty well. Destro you got VOP major which with crashing chaos azerite talent can put your infernal on a 2 minute cooldown which is pretty good for some awesome burst windows in M+. Aff lock is more for tyrannical weeks and if you know how to properly aoe with him but brings a ton of boss damage to the dungeon and isn't an awful pick either. Demo lock has a lot of options with talents and essences to mess with your dps. The one thing I'm here to complain about is why for all 3 of these specs, it makes no sense to make a kick bound to a pet.

All i'm asking out of the post is if people agree with the statement that warlocks shouldn't be binded to one pet having our kick and should give us a kick with felhunter given a new set of skills or just removed. The fact that i'm forced to go felguard because its doing over 30 percent of my damage in M+ and suffering from getting into groups because i'm immobile and have no kick really tilts me. Most people would also say that you can make it up by queuing with a prot pal for 2 kicks but the fact of the matter is, we are the only class in the entire game that doesn't have a kick given to us without some special feature like having to summon a felhunter out.

How is it fair to expect me to endure a 10-30% win rate in what is supposed to be a random, fun, and fair game mode? At the very least, allow me to go into mercenary mode and play as horde. It shouldn't take me 8 hours just to get a first win of the day in.",1

https://i.redd.it/q8kzu1eh9lq31.jpg

**Overview**

I enjoy working out ways to improve/create new ways to play WoW, my favorite game.  I hope you all enjoy, please feel free to leave comments to add to the discussion. Currently, I think Tank gameplay as a whole is incredibly spammy, uninteresting, and unfulfilling. I don't think it needs to be this way.

**Specialization/Class Fantasy**

Warriors (the class) aren't your average run-of-the-mill ""Sword and Board"" footmen and standard infantry units of the Warcraft mythos. They are incredibly skilled, mighty, and in some cases, vicious. The Protection Warrior to me feels flat and uninteresting. It is centered around passively negating damage through the use/spam of short cooldown defensive abilities and small buffs (like Commanding Shout, Ignore Pain, and Shield Wall.) **Instead**, I propose a more active playstyle, which focuses on the long-removed Stances. How your Warrior chooses to hold himself relative to his shield is the main focus of the proposed Protection Warrior gameplay change. To fit the ""Masterful"" playstyle, this design generates Threat through Critical Strikes, rather than passively through just sitting in Tank Spec. This allows for a more impactful and noticeable contribution as a tank to your group.

**Redesigning the ""Stance""**

Protection Warriors used to essentially stay in a ""defensive stance"" for most of their time tanking a dungeon. Sometimes, you could swap out to use certain abilities, like Thunderclap, but it wasn't necessary smooth or conducive to Rage efficiency. Instead, I want to propose a more ""active"" playstyle for the Protection Warrior. Your **Stance** is a very powerful toggle which requires strategic changing in order to defeat your opponent. You should always be swapping stances during combat to overwhelm and outsmart your opponent. You should NEVER just leave your stance in one place. Everything about this new Protection Warrior centers around when to PROPERLY and EFFECTIVELY swap your Stance to either defend against savage blows or dish out some revenge to your enemy. Utilizing your stance effectively is will ultimately determine if you are a good player or a bad player. A lot of abilities will be the same as they are now, with key differences being the abilities below. **This is not an all-inclusive design, and runs on the assumption there will be other abilities and talents to fill in the blanks. This is a brief overview of what I imagine a fun tank would be to play.**

**Inspiration:**

**Offensive Stance**

[Shield to the side, weapon ready. When the ENEMY is on the defensive. ](https://i.redd.it/7vo955pu1kq31.png)

\&amp;amp;#x200B;

**Defensive Stance:**

[Shield to the Front, weapon to the side. When YOU are on the defensive. ](https://i.redd.it/s75uq3922kq31.png)

\&amp;amp;#x200B;

**Spells and Abilties**

* **Stance Mastery (New Passive)**
   * You are able to change your Fighting Stance, significantly altering your fighting style to outwit your opponent. Stances last indefinitely, and have a 6 second cooldown before you can change your stance again. **NOTE:** Stances don't require a preemptive ability like ""Turn the Tables"" to toggle, however these abilities are meant to help bridge and synergize the duality of the Offensive/Defensive playstyles.
* **Defensive Stance (New Toggle)** *This is where you primarily BUILD Rage.*
   * Enter a Defensive Stance. While in the Defensive Stance, you have no auto attack. Damage taken is reduced by an additional 20%. Your Block chance is doubled, and you can Block projectiles. In addition, you gain access to special Defensive Stance abilities. *This new stance has a much more powerful effect, and has a unique animation where your character situates themselves behind their shield.*
   * **Opportunity Attack** (Replaces Heroic Strike in Def stance)
      * When you Block a Melee attack, you can use **Opportunity Attack**. This is a Hard-Hitting spell which automatically Crits and can not be dodged, blocked, or parried. It has a \~2 second cooldown and generates rage.
   * **Redouble** (New **Defensive Stance** Ability)
      * Redouble your efforts, regaining 10% of your maximum HP rapidly over 3 seconds. In addition, your movement speed is increased by 40% during this time. Note: Each stance has some sort of movement buff to help with repositioning. However, each stance has unique flavor.
   * **Iron Will**  (New **Defensive Stance** Ability)
      * Focus on your task at hand, making you temporarily immune to Charm, Sleep, and Fear effects for 3 seconds. Uninterruptible channel. (Can be stopped early by canceling the ability or by being Stunned or Displaced)
   * **Shield Bash** (Redesigned)
      * Bash your opponent, dealing damage equal to 1/4 your shield's Armor Rating and Dazing the enemy for 3 seconds.
   * **Striking Edge** (New Spell)
      * Strike your opponent with your shield's edge, dealing Minor Damage and interrupting them. If this ability Critically Hits, it will additionally silence them for 1 second.
   * **Turn the Tables** (New Spell)
      * Aggressively thrusts your shield forward and to the side, dealing Minor Damage and knocking them back 3 yards. In addition, your subsequent **Offensive Stance** spell within 3 seconds will consume no rage.
* **Offensive Stance (New Toggle)** *This is where you primarily SPEND Rage.*
   * Enter an Offensive Stance. While in Offensive Stance, you can attack freely. However, you gain no bonus Defensive capabilities. In addition, you gain access to Offensive Stance abilties. Your critical strike chance is increased by X%.
   * **Concussive Blow** (New Spell)
      * Place your weight into your swing. Deal X Damage to the target and stun them for 2 seconds. Consumes Rage. If target is immune to stuns, it automatically Crits instead.
   * **Sever** (New Spell)
      * Strike at your opponent's extremities, dealing X Damage and Disarming them for 2 seconds. If this ability Crits, the opponent will be disarmed for 4 seconds instead.
   * **Lunging Thrust** (New Spell)
      * Thrust your blade forward through your opponents, charging 6 yards forward and dealing X damage to those in your path.  Consumes Rage.
   * **Shield Wall!** (Redesigned Spell; Long cooldown)
      * Gain an absorb shield, absorbing X damage for 3 seconds. In addition, you automatically enter **Defensive Stance.** *This is your new OH SHIT spell.*
   * **Arterial Focus** (Offensive Cooldown)
      * For 10 seconds, your critical strike chance is increased by 10% and you now apply a Bleed every time you critically hit an enemy.
   * **Denial** (New Spell)
      * You anticipate your opponents next move. You automatically Parry their next attack or Resist their next spell. In addition, your next Defensive Stance spell generates double Rage. Lasts 5 seconds.

**Cyclical Synergy**

* To help negate squatting in one Stance for too long, I designed this to purposefully rely on being in both numerously.
   * Defensive Stance to Negate and Build Rage
   * Offensive Stance to Consume Rage to Generate Threat
   * **Opener: Charge** is there just like before, to help get your opening Rage pool.
   * **Passive Threat is Gone** or Mostly Removed. I don't want this to end like other tank specs where you just *exist* and automatically hold aggro. You must actively Generate/Consume Rage to Generate Threat. Generate Threat means more damage to you, which requires you to swap to Defensive to Negate.

https://i.redd.it/q8kzu1eh9lq31.jpg

**Overview**

I enjoy working out ways to improve/create new ways to play WoW, my favorite game.  I hope you all enjoy, please feel free to leave comments to add to the discussion. Currently, I think Tank gameplay as a whole is incredibly spammy, uninteresting, and unfulfilling. I don't think it needs to be this way.

**Specialization/Class Fantasy**

Warriors (the class) aren't your average run-of-the-mill ""Sword and Board"" footmen and standard infantry units of the Warcraft mythos. They are incredibly skilled, mighty, and in some cases, vicious. The Protection Warrior to me feels flat and uninteresting. It is centered around passively negating damage through the use/spam of short cooldown defensive abilities and small buffs (like Commanding Shout, Ignore Pain, and Shield Wall.) **Instead**, I propose a more active playstyle, which focuses on the long-removed Stances. How your Warrior chooses to hold himself relative to his shield is the main focus of the proposed Protection Warrior gameplay change. To fit the ""Masterful"" playstyle, this design generates Threat through Critical Strikes, rather than passively through just sitting in Tank Spec. This allows for a more impactful and noticeable contribution as a tank to your group.

**Redesigning the ""Stance""**

Protection Warriors used to essentially stay in a ""defensive stance"" for most of their time tanking a dungeon. Sometimes, you could swap out to use certain abilities, like Thunderclap, but it wasn't necessary smooth or conducive to Rage efficiency. Instead, I want to propose a more ""active"" playstyle for the Protection Warrior. Your **Stance** is a very powerful toggle which requires strategic changing in order to defeat your opponent. You should always be swapping stances during combat to overwhelm and outsmart your opponent. You should NEVER just leave your stance in one place. Everything about this new Protection Warrior centers around when to PROPERLY and EFFECTIVELY swap your Stance to either defend against savage blows or dish out some revenge to your enemy. Utilizing your stance effectively is will ultimately determine if you are a good player or a bad player. A lot of abilities will be the same as they are now, with key differences being the abilities below. **This is not an all-inclusive design, and runs on the assumption there will be other abilities and talents to fill in the blanks. This is a brief overview of what I imagine a fun tank would be to play.**

**Inspiration:**

**Offensive Stance**

[Shield to the side, weapon ready. When the ENEMY is on the defensive. ](https://i.redd.it/7vo955pu1kq31.png)

\&amp;amp;#x200B;

**Defensive Stance:**

[Shield to the Front, weapon to the side. When YOU are on the defensive. ](https://i.redd.it/s75uq3922kq31.png)

\&amp;amp;#x200B;

**Spells and Abilties**

* **Stance Mastery (New Passive)**
   * You are able to change your Fighting Stance, significantly altering your fighting style to outwit your opponent. Stances last indefinitely, and have a 6 second cooldown before you can change your stance again. **NOTE:** Stances don't require a preemptive ability like ""Turn the Tables"" to toggle, however these abilities are meant to help bridge and synergize the duality of the Offensive/Defensive playstyles.
* **Defensive Stance (New Toggle)** *This is where you primarily BUILD Rage.*
   * Enter a Defensive Stance. While in the Defensive Stance, you have no auto attack. Damage taken is reduced by an additional 20%. Your Block chance is doubled, and you can Block projectiles. In addition, you gain access to special Defensive Stance abilities. *This new stance has a much more powerful effect, and has a unique animation where your character situates themselves behind their shield.*
   * **Opportunity Attack** (Replaces Heroic Strike in Def stance)
      * When you Block a Melee attack, you can use **Opportunity Attack**. This is a Hard-Hitting spell which automatically Crits and can not be dodged, blocked, or parried. It has a \~2 second cooldown and generates rage.
   * **Redouble** (New **Defensive Stance** Ability)
      * Redouble your efforts, regaining 10% of your maximum HP rapidly over 3 seconds. In addition, your movement speed is increased by 40% during this time. Note: Each stance has some sort of movement buff to help with repositioning. However, each stance has unique flavor.
   * **Iron Will**  (New **Defensive Stance** Ability)
      * Focus on your task at hand, making you temporarily immune to Charm, Sleep, and Fear effects for 3 seconds. Uninterruptible channel. (Can be stopped early by canceling the ability or by being Stunned or Displaced)
   * **Shield Bash** (Redesigned)
      * Bash your opponent, dealing damage equal to 1/4 your shield's Armor Rating and Dazing the enemy for 3 seconds.
   * **Striking Edge** (New Spell)
      * Strike your opponent with your shield's edge, dealing Minor Damage and interrupting them. If this ability Critically Hits, it will additionally silence them for 1 second.
   * **Turn the Tables** (New Spell)
      * Aggressively thrusts your shield forward and to the side, dealing Minor Damage and knocking them back 3 yards. In addition, your subsequent **Offensive Stance** spell within 3 seconds will consume no rage.
* **Offensive Stance (New Toggle)** *This is where you primarily SPEND Rage.*
   * Enter an Offensive Stance. While in Offensive Stance, you can attack freely. However, you gain no bonus Defensive capabilities. In addition, you gain access to Offensive Stance abilties. Your critical strike chance is increased by X%.
   * **Concussive Blow** (New Spell)
      * Place your weight into your swing. Deal X Damage to the target and stun them for 2 seconds. Consumes Rage. If target is immune to stuns, it automatically Crits instead.
   * **Sever** (New Spell)
      * Strike at your opponent's extremities, dealing X Damage and Disarming them for 2 seconds. If this ability Crits, the opponent will be disarmed for 4 seconds instead.
   * **Lunging Thrust** (New Spell)
      * Thrust your blade forward through your opponents, charging 6 yards forward and dealing X damage to those in your path.  Consumes Rage.
   * **Shield Wall!** (Redesigned Spell; Long cooldown)
      * Gain an absorb shield, absorbing X damage for 3 seconds. In addition, you automatically enter **Defensive Stance.** *This is your new OH SHIT spell.*
   * **Arterial Focus** (Offensive Cooldown)
      * For 10 seconds, your critical strike chance is increased by 10% and you now apply a Bleed every time you critically hit an enemy.
   * **Denial** (New Spell)
      * You anticipate your opponents next move. You automatically Parry their next attack or Resist their next spell. In addition, your next Defensive Stance spell generates double Rage. Lasts 5 seconds.

**Cyclical Synergy**

* To help negate squatting in one Stance for too long, I designed this to purposefully rely on being in both numerously.
   * Defensive Stance to Negate and Build Rage
   * Offensive Stance to Consume Rage to Generate Threat
   * **Opener: Charge** is there just like before, to help get your opening Rage pool.
   * **Passive Threat is Gone** or Mostly Removed. I don't want this to end like other tank specs where you just *exist* and automatically hold aggro. You must actively Generate/Consume Rage to Generate Threat. Generate Threat means more damage to you, which requires you to swap to Defensive to Negate. Once your Rage pool is back up, you can swap back to Offensive to expend that Rage and gather more Threat.

3174,"Serious question, why are people suddenly against Undead in the Alliance?","I‚Äôm not asking this to spark controversy, but the possibility of a portion of Undead joining the Alliance has caused some anger, but I personally don‚Äôt see an issue with it. The part that confuses me is that we‚Äôve had Undead in the Alliance since WotLK.

From what I‚Äôve gathered, the main reason we accepted the DK‚Äôs and not the Forsaken is the atrocity in Lordaeron when mind controlled. While Death Knights were also mind controlled to commit an atrocity, the leader of the Silver Hand vouched for them to basically say ‚Äúthese guys are chill‚Äù, so I can at least see where Alliance members came from when initially accepting one and not the other.

It‚Äôs common knowledge in the lore that many Forsaken retain their memories and emotions, and I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too farfetched for some of them to defect at some point. Sure, the smell and appearance could be considered offensive, but if the Horde could get used to it, so could we. (And keep in mind, the DK‚Äôs are still decaying, albeit a much slower rate)

On the topic of Light-based Undead, I once again do not see much of an issue. We know that Light and Shadow are polar opposites, and infusing an Undead with Light could definitely make sense if Blizz does a decent job justifying it.

3186,Forsaken turning their back on Sylvanas.,"I have seen a lot of criticism about this, both here and in other wow discussion platforms. The running theme and the general consensus seems to be that it doesn't make sense for the Forsaken, who was never really loyal to the Horde, to care what Sylvanas said in *Reckoning* cinematic. However, I feel like one massive bit of information is being missed, or ignored in this line of thought:

The Forsaken post-Cataclysm is different than Vanilla Forsaken. This faction is not solely made up of Scourge defectors who own their freedom and survival to Sylvanas. A significant portion of the people in post-Cataclysm Forsaken, are people who never knew the Scourge. They were dead before and then they were raised by Sylvanas into undeath (against their will) and rolled with it. Either because they saw this as a neat little opportunity to live a few more extra years, or because they had a terrible afterlife experience which they wanted to avoid, or they were simply too confused, too scared to do anything but accept their fate.

Furthermore, a substantial portion of these people are killed by Sylvanas and her soldiers in the first place. People in Hillsbrad, Southshore, Gilneas and more. It was always a nonsensical spot in the lore that those who died fighting against her would turn in and serve her so willingly immediately after undeath, yet it was hand-waved away by Blizzard for years. 

So all those people who maybe got convinced, manipulated or scared into obedience by the existing cult of personality, were not so keen and so loyal after all. And remember, we always had (albeit rare) ‚ÄúForsaken‚Äù characters who did not like Sylvanas or even left the faction long before. 

So now, all the people who never really had a true reason to be loyal, hear her say ‚ÄúYou are all nothing‚Äù and go ‚ÄúOh yeah! Well fuck you too, never liked you anyway!‚Äù Which makes perfect sense to me.

This recent situation does not retroactively salvages a poorly thought-out piece of lore. But that seemingly poorly thought-out piece of lore does make it so this new lore makes sense.

We know some are still loyal, in open or in secret. We know others have turned on her. This is an ideal contrast to reflect the different segments of the Forsaken: The old devout Scourge defectors, and the new unwilling recruits.",1570232151.0,"Forsaken turning their back on Sylvanas.I have seen a lot of criticism about this, both here and in other wow discussion platforms.

3222,Inktober Murloc by Katerina/Hekate Lefay,"I met my girlfriend the beginning of this year.  She had played up to WotLK before.  Seeing I still play WoW (casual) I've gotten her a PC and now we both nerd together.

Following a collection guide, I noticed I was missing the cute white Murloc from Borean Tundra (sneeky hidden egg you!).  She obviously also had to gather it, so we both went and got the little fellow.  Seeing how cute he dances with his little hat on, it was an obvious choice for the first ink drawing for this year's Inktober.  Hope you all enjoy it ;)

For those who are thinking: what is Inktober?  If you choose to participate as an artist, you commit to drawing one ink drawing each day in October.  
I'm already certain more WoW related images may pop up :)

3270,Returning has been SO much fun this time,"Just taking this EU server update opportunity to reflect over how fun it's been to come back to WoW this time! 

I used to play since the very beginning in 2005 (I even bought the special edition on a whim and still so proud of my little panda pet). Before then, I was an avid FFXI player, and I could never quite get that amazing feeling that FFXI gave me partying and really having to hone your skills and reach goals with your guild and that sense of community. I had an ok time in vanilla but my guild ran away from me and were raiding before I could get to 60. Life made me leave, and then I skipped BC altogether and came back in Wotlk.

Now Wotlk, that was badass. I had SUCH a good time, I found a great community, and a lot of my RL friends were also playing at the time. It made me happy just to think about logging in, and once because I had to travel somewhere for 2 weeks, a guildie I hadn't even met irl logged in for me every day and did my daily dungeons and dalaran quests for me, we were that tightly knit. I really missed those days after I quit playing (straight after Cata).

I tried to return several times since, probably once every expansion, but I could never quite get into it. The sense of community like before wasn't there as much, people were disenchanted and bored, no one said anything in LFD, it was just a grind. I didn't even try Draenor.

Then came Classic, and several of my vanilla mates begged me to come back to relive the old days. I finally caved and downloaded it and we had some fun times. But I think everyone was wearing rose tinted nostalgia glasses if I'm honest - it got boring real fast (I'm so sorry, Classic fans). For someone who no longer has that much free time to spend on games as an adult with shit to do, Classic just drags on too much. I was giving up, and before I quit it, I decided just to have a look and see what retail has to offer before I uninstalled it.

Well, uninstalling never happened, that's for sure. Damn, everything has changed, but dare I say for the better in nearly every way! LFD is an absolute riot if only I can get people to chat (and most of the time, people do!). I play holy priest, and I met this monk tank from some other server, and for days we've had a hilarious time together doing dungeons, making jokes, and keep getting more people on our fun, making the dungeon leveling an actual pleasure to do. I also joined a lovely guild with lots of experienced kind people, and now I worry I won't leave the game for ages, lol.

Everything is so much more fun to do than ever, and people seem very energised and happy to play. I used to miss that FFXI party feeling where you would look for a party and try it for ages, and then when you finally found a great constellation of players, you would stay together for ages just because it worked, and it's the same now with dungeons in WoW. It's that feeling of finding a good random group and having an actual good time with it because you find a rhythm together and your skills work well in unison.

I'm enjoying a lot that everything scales to level, because you can actually play together with friends/guildies more easily - it's an excellent idea. I'm enjoying that you can do all the dungeons easily, it opens up to experience more of the content and not make it so repetitive (like vanilla was, for instance). I really really love achievements. I'm enjoying that it's easy to get more gear and upgrade it, that you can change your appearance, I'm enjoying all the pet stuff and I'm looking forward to when the game gets harder and takes more effort to skill up and gear up. There's probably a lot more that I will enjoy that I haven't even had the chance to try yet (what are garrisons??? What is this mythic +?? Haha). I'm nearly level 60 now, and I'm happily looking forward to getting to 100 so that my guild can help me gear up and finally teach me to raid at 120.

Also, I've been 1 single achievement away from ""What a long, strange trip it's been"" for a decade, maybe I will finally get it this time. That would be really special to be honest.

Basically I haven't felt this good playing an MMO since 2009, so thanks for reading my ode to WoW.

Cheers, and may the wind be at your back ;)

I used to play since the very beginning in 2005 (I even bought the special edition on a whim and still so proud of my little panda pet). Before then, I was an avid FFXI player, and I could never quite get that amazing feeling that FFXI gave me partying and really having to hone your skills and reach goals with your guild and that sense of community. I had an ok time in vanilla but my guild ran away from me and were raiding before I could get to 60. Life made me leave, and then I skipped BC altogether and came back in Wotlk.

Now Wotlk, that was badass. I had SUCH a good time, I found a great community, and a lot of my RL friends were also playing at the time.

3299,My ideas for Balance Druid [Opinions Welcome],"So, first things first.  I'm not entirely talking out of my ass, or at least I'd like to think I'm not (7/8H 8/8N, ofc not the best but not the worst).  My main is a balance druid, and I would like to say I'm not bad at it, though I'm by no means the best.  That being said, I'm NOT commenting on its power, simply how I would improve the **playstyle**.  I'm going to refrain to only suggesting three changes to the class, even though I know this'll have no effect.  It's just my observations and what I enjoy (or don't) about Balance.

**#1:** Starlord is a great talent.  
I love the way Starlord plays when you actually play around with it and make use of the possible micromanagement it offers.  That being said, I wish it was baseline, and instead there was a talent to increase its value, ergo making it more worthwhile to actually ""play"" with it - the talent's fine, but I think it should better emphasize spending the time to manage the stacks and your Starsurge casts.  Correct me if I'm wrong, it doesn't seem to have super high importance atm, and can usually be disregarded when talented, just taking it as a passive Haste increase.

**#2:** Starfall is kinda shit.  
Starfall is god awful at the moment.  I can't remember the last time I actually cast it without fat-fingering once or twice.  Fact of the matter is, Arcanic Pulsar and Streaking Stars just devalue it a ton in comparison to Starsurge, on top of Starsurge being the only one of the two that gives Empowerments.  I'm not entirely sure how I'd fix this, but the first thing that comes to mind is making Arcanic Pulsar affected by Starfall, and making Starfall last a bit longer while still doing the same damage per tick (about 31% of your Spell Power every 2s, if I'm not mistaken) - so maybe instead of the current 124% over 8s, 155% over 10s - same ratio, just longer, and affected by Arcanic Pulsar.

**#3:** Not a BFA thing, but...  
For the love of all that is holy, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, Blizzard, (not that they'd be reading this lmao) keep Arcanic Pulsar and potentially Streaking Stars between BFA and 9.0.  They alone make Balance worth playing to me.  I love the micromanagement brought about by hitting the 8th Arcanic Pulsar stack - pooling to 80 AP, casting Starsurge, casting Solar Wrath, Starsurge, etc.  It's a wonderfully rewarding way to play the class, and one of my favorite parts about it.

That's it.  If we just got those three things changed or kept, I would be insanely happy.  Like, Balance Druid is already fun.  If those two things get changed and the two traits are kept, that'd be amazing, and cement it as my favorite spec in my entire time playing the game.

Agree?  Disagree?  I'd love to hear.  By no means are my opinions the only valid opinions, nor are they 100% correct, no doubt.  I just want to see Balance Druid stay as such a fun spec, and get more fun, if such a thing can be asked.",1570168930.0,"My ideas for Balance Druid [Opinions Welcome]So, first things first.

3331,I want advice on how to play a druid.,"  So I've always wanted to play a druid but don't know HOW to play a druid. I've never really leveled any of the spell classes (mage, warlock, shaman, etc) or the rogue class. I've never really played as a tank. I've only done ""run into a mob or two and hope I kill them before they kill me"" with pally, DK, and now DH. I don't know why, probably just because I haven't practiced enough, but I just can't seem to master those classes.

Now, I've come back and finally unlocked kul tiran humans. I'm currently playing a feral Druid, and I would like some tips and tricks to better be able to play this. I'm just fresh off the market, still level 20 (legit started him last night) and only have the first talent slot picked. I know to use Tiger's lust, and I picked the talent that lets you use moonbeam in cat form and gives one combo point.

So now that I've said that... I guess some things I'd like advice on is what talents you have picked, do you use thrash over shred, should I instead choose sabertooth or predator over lunar inspiration? Or should I do Guardian or the balance instead? I want to really learn how to play a druid, and get somewhere with him this time around.

   And please, keep it civil. I'm just asking for advice on how to be a better player. I don't want any negative comments or ""choose another class"" or anything like that.

3374,How long should I wait before trying to try out for a guild atm?,"To start, my goal is to get into a guild that's doing 2 nights of raiding a week and progressing Mythic. I'm extremely concerned about finding a guild that's still raiding with the decline in sub count and that my chances at getting a spot in one are low but I figure I have to try. Ultimately, I'd like to be in the type of guild that gets CE after nerfs and right before the next tier. I don't really care about being first, I just really enjoy challenging content.

So, I have a fuck ton of raiding experience but, at this moment, with the ilvl inflation and all that I'm just not sure how behind I actually am. I usually lean heavily on my previous tier mythic experience  but last tier I only cleared 3 bosses on Mythic which is very far from impressive. On top of that, I switched toons for this tier which definitely doesn't make my life any easier.

Here's my character :

[https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/stormrage/mieleki](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/stormrage/mieleki)

&#x200B;

I've been back to the game for exactly one week at this point and I've been doing what I can to get geared up ASAP. Yesterday I got the BiS Belt finally (50 rolls total, if anyone wanted to know).

&#x200B;

Things that I know I'm very behind on :

\- Neck : I don't want to apply to a guild until I'm minimum of 65 neck, I think that should be fine.

\- Essences: Shadow Priest essences are time gated, this is kinda shit but it is what it is. I'm Rank 1 Lucid (almost 2) and Rank 1 Blood of the Enemy, Also only rank 1 pure flame for now. I should probably have my rank 2 Focusing Iris in the neck atm but, intelligent me, I forgot to unlock the heart before my buddy carried me through a 10.

\- Logs: This is a doozy, I don't really know how to go about getting logs. Basically I am too undergeared to get into real pugs and I don't have the gold to afford a Palace Carry atm. Feels bad man.

&#x200B;

The essences are my big question, should I wait to have full BiS essences before I even try to apply to a guild? I'm doing basically everything I can for my neck (islands, mission table, WQs, emissaries) and for my gear as well (+10 every week) but I'm pretty heavily gated by Azerite vendors. I'm 2 weeks away from my first 445 piece and my rank 3 Focusing Iris.

3386,thanks wow,"i have terrible anxiety, particularly social.

when i first started playing wow a few years ago, i was too afraid to even join LFD. god forbid anyone tried to strike up a casual conversation with me, it would instill fear in me like nothing else.but people did just that. and with every random interaction with players, i would grow a little more confident. i'd find myself asking questions back instead of trying to find an excuse to end the conversation sooner.

since that first uncomfortable conversation, i started trying to be the friendly person in dungeon finder. a lot of the time a greeting will be met with silence. maybe because they don't speak english, since it is eu after all. or maybe they just aren't interested in talking.

talking to people still gets my heart racing, but i try to power through it. if i didn't, i would have missed out on a lot of good experiences. here are just some of them... \^\^

when 8.2 first came out, i had a lot of fun talking to people in mechagon. general chat was quite lively and i'd hang out with people while camping rares. i even had people that i'd met there recognise me in other places in the world. xd

a while back i decided to give tanking a go after wanting to for so long, but never comitting to it because of craaazy (surprise surprise) anxiety holding me back. ended up making friends with another lowbie in my guild and we ended up levelling together all the way to 120 over the course of a week or so.

while farming sightless eyes in the underbelly, i made friends with two horde players. we goofed around for a bit and eventually they led me to the vendor that sells the elixir of tongues. i kind of panicked when i realised our ability to communicate was no longer limited to emotes, but the anxiety subsided after a while. x)

about a month ago i even worked up the courage to sign up for a raid on one of my alts. somehow i ended up leading the raid, i guess 'cause i was tank. we were just doing glory of the argus raider, but it was still a pretty big deal to me to command the attention of so many people i'd never met before. and to have it pay off by getting the achievement for everyone was thrilling! :D

anyway, i just want to show my appreciation to all of the nice people who play this game. you really helped me, even if it was unknowingly. thanks to you, the social aspect of this game is no longer my personal hell, but a comfort when i'm feeling alone.sure there are a lot of toxic people, as with any game, but it's the kind people that leave an impression. at least that's how it is with me. :>

edit: i didn't really expect more than 2 people to see this. it's not really that deep, i just got over some anxiety about a game & wanted to make a nice feelgood post dedicated to friendly players for being cool. not really worth writing an angry comment about. yes, i obviously am seeing a professional. thanks for your concern. /s

I played BfA when it launched (or a bit later) and just leveled to 111 but left and now I want to come back.

I have some questions

1 - I'm using heirlooms but I have the azerite chestpiece or whatever is called so is better than the heirloom. Is it worth to use the heirloom for the 10% xp boost or the xp boosted is not going to be worth the slower it gets me to get that xp?

2 - I have a DK 110 and not really sure where I am at regarding class hall quest but I want to get the class mount for the DK. Has this been improved so is faster now that is previous expa content?

3 - I play fairly casual and I'm only interested in unlocking the fat humans. How long does that normally take? I'm not looking to get it now just want to know more or less if playing casually (about 2 hours a day) will take 2 months or a year.

Here are some examples of quest texts:

  

¬∑ This passage flows through the Shrine of the Storm out into the open sea. We will release the souls of the fallen here. Legends say that as our spirits pass through the Shrine, they aid in the great blessing rituals that all Kul Tiran ships undergo. In that way, we Stormsong never stop serving our people.

¬∑  You see those salty looking guys in red? That's the Irontide crew. They're the worst of the worst. Cutthroats and brigands, to a man. Irontide wouldn't be guarding the docks if they didn't stand to gain something... Lighten their pockets. See what kinda hardware they've got.

¬∑ Meerah here found your friend in the dunes. The lightning strike nearly killed her. It might still, without treatment. The wasps within the grove have a painful sting, but their venom also has restorative properties. I can extract what I need from their glands.

3448,I was wrongfully perma banned from World of Warcraft..,"I have been **permanently** banned from World of Warcraft, I believe this ban was wrongfully enforced. [RESOLVED]

This ban came out of nowhere after having this account active for the past 6 years. Not once have I received any warnings, or gotten any bans. I was told that is was because of the ""Unauthorized Cheat Programs (Hacks)"". This makes absolutely no sense to me as for the past month I have been playing classic wow on a brand new laptop with the blizzard client, wow, discord and steam being the only applications on my computer. 

I have been extremely diligent on not using any 3rd party programs as I have spend countless amount of money and 1000's of hours on this account. To then get a perma ban out of nowhere and without warning breaks my heart.

**Backstory to ban:**
I currently am traveling around South Korea and have been for the past ~3 weeks. Up until 3 hours and 40 minutes before my ban the only computer I played on was my new laptop. However yesterday we had to change Airbnb's and decided to hit up a local PC Cafe while we wait for our new Airbnb to be ready. I played for 3 hours at the PC Cafe and went to our new accommodation.

Upon logging into my wow account at the new location I noticed I could not log in and was told my account was banned. 

I have lived in South Korea for 8 months previously and have spent countless hours in PC Cafe's over the past 6 years of having this account. The only think I can think of is this particular PC cafe had some 3rd party software running in the background, which triggered an automatic ban on the account. It came 40 minutes after logging off at the PC cafe.

**I sent in an appeal ticket, however I got the templated response of:**

>My name is Game Master ******, I want to thank you so much for your patience while I looked into your ticket today. 

>I understand that you are wanting to appeal the ban on this World of Warcraft account. Upon further investigation, it appears that this >action was taken in accordance with our Code of Conduct https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/42673 and EULA >http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/legal/eula.html which all players must agree to in order to play our games. 

>Due to this, the ban will be upheld and will not be overturned. Please note that this issue is now considered closed, and further inquiries on this may not receive a response. If you have any other issues feel free to contact us again. Take care and have a good rest of your day.

With all of that being said, does anyone know if there is a way to contact the somebody high up at Blizzard so that I can talk to them and get this fixed? I will pursue this as far as possible.

**UPDATE #1**
Just got a callback from Blizzard phone support. I talked with Christina and she agreed with what I was saying surrounding the incident at the PC Cafe. She has extensive knowledge on the workings of PC cafes and said she will be vouching for me. However I have to wait up-to 72 hours to get a resolution as this needs to go to two separate review teams. So fingers crossed reddit. Thanks so much for the help upvoting and giving this the exposure it deserves. The struggle is not over yet, however it looks less grim than before. I will update once I get a email followup from this phone discussion.

**UPDATE #2**
This has been resolved. I want to thank everyone for the support and comments, it meant the world to me. Here is the resolution email image for those who constantly think I'm lying or hiding something - https://imgur.com/a/VG4PEb2. For those that stumble across this in the future that have a similar problem I would strongly recommend opening a ticket and selecting to get a callback from blizzard. The customer experience was night and day. I would like to make a special shoutout to Christina from blizzard phone support, and u/araxom for reaching out to me to help me in this issue.

3518,Class Concept: Aspect,"Yeah yeah, I know. This has as much chance of getting into the game as I have of winning the lottery five times in a row without buying a ticket, but my brain is refusing to go to sleep until I type this out. So here we go, a class concept for being the new Aspect ... of Everything.

Races: All. If you spend time on Azeroth you can be an Aspect.  
Armor: Mail. It's undersaturated with only two classes.  
Weapons: Any, but depends on spec.

Specs:

Aspect of Earth. **Break yourselves upon my body! FEEL the strength of the Earth!**  
Specialize in standing there and taking a beating. Skills include armor boosts and lots of them, turning into an Earth elemental or other rocky creature, and basically being your usual stand-there-and-take-it kind of tank. Brute force is the way forward with two-handed weapons.

Aspect of the Emerald Dream. **They cannot hit what they cannot see.**  
Evasion tank. Survive by almost never getting hit and recover in the Dream when you do with self-heals. CC adds by unleashing the Nightmare on them.

Aspect of Life. **You get a heal. You get a heal. EVERYONE gets a heal!**  
Yeah, you guessed it. The healing spec. Purify your friends of toxins and curses and death with cleansing, cleaning fire. Lots of fire. Drain life out of the enemies (does not work well on undead and constructs without actual life force!) and give it to your allies, or burn the undead with your cleansing fire.

Aspect of Magic. **Watch, mortals, as your precious magic betrays you!**  
Ranged magic spec similar to Arcane Mage but with more explosions. Situationally useful against magical enemies due to skills that hamper the enemy's magic, prevents it entirely, and makes it backfire when used. You don't obey magic; magic obeys you.

Aspect of Time. **Let's try that again.**  
DPS/Support. WoW doesn't really have a support class or support spec, and obviously this one needs to be able to hold its own when out in the world killing things. The specialty of Time would be debuffs, making enemies prone to being hit by the same attack several times, undoing their previous attacks when next they attack (effectively a heal) and so on.

Class features. What, being the Aspect of Everything isn't enough for you? Alright, how about this. In-combat spec changes on a cooldown. Hit a burn phase? Swap from healer to DPS and nuke the boss, then swap back in time to save your team from dying like the fire-standers they are.

Start at level ... How about level 85, right after the events of Cataclysm which changed the existing Aspects forever. Or after Legion when Azeroth herself changed - since this won't be a BfA class, that still leaves a fair amount of leveling similar to DKs when they were released.

3526,How my friend got me into WoW to be his personal 2s partner in Burning Crusade,"Hi. After telling my new friend group about my WoW experiences, I felt like sharing it with you guys because I probably need therapy or something. I‚Äôm not looking for anything in particular, just wanted to share what I feel like is an interesting story.

I started WoW at Burning Crusade. I used to play Guild Wars because it didn‚Äôt have a subscription fee, but my high school best friend at the time always teased me for it.

My relationship with this friend was *interesting*. We spent all our breaks together, would chat on the phone or Skype together after school and he would want me to tell him everything I was doing. Once I was playing Dawn of War and wanted to get off the phone but he told me to verbalize what was happening. So I did, and when I won by sending in a stream of dreadnoughts, we were both cheering on the phone. However, I was always secretly afraid of him. He was the meanest person I knew and everybody else thought he was super cool because of how mean he was. He made a few kids transfer, and I always felt guilty that I took part in the bullying because I didn‚Äôt want him to pick on me.

One day while we were on a school trip, he brought his laptop and bought me a WoW account. He told me to play a Troll rogue even though I thought Blood Elves were cooler. (Yeah I know BE‚Äôs are for weebs) I remember it was pretty fun. So when we got back from the trip, I started playing WoW with him and he carried me throughout the game. He would buy BoE gear for my character so we could do BG‚Äôs at 20, 30, 40 etc. He invited me to the top guild in the server. We were on Skype everyday, doing every dungeon and seeing my character get all this sweet blue gear with sick enchants on them. Whenever we were questing and I would run into someone my level, he told me to duel them. Hunters were always stupid to duel against, but I did it anyways.

One time at Silithus, I was leveling on my own and a lvl 70 alliance dude found me and killed me. No big deal, it‚Äôs a PvP server and I‚Äôm used to it. I mentioned I was killed on Skype, and my friend instantly asks where I am and what class is the dude. Within moments he rides up with his mage and smokes the dude who killed me. That guy calls out his guild, and my friend and I fight off his guild. My friend was one of the top 5 mages in the battlegroup, so he was basically carrying me in this fight. We kept dying but coming back up and taking more of them down.

Once I reached 70, there would be days after school he would tell me to sit outside Org and fight everyone I see, and he would watch and tell me after what I should have done. His goal was he needed a rogue to do 2‚Äôs with him all the time, and all the carrying and practicing lead to this goal. I remember doing 2v2‚Äôs with him was the worst, because I obviously wasn‚Äôt top 5 battlegroup tier. Specifically there was one match in the Undercity Arena, where in the middle of the match where he was barraging me with questions on why I‚Äôm so shitty he told me this:

‚ÄúStop stop stop stop. Stop everything you‚Äôre doing. Just stop. Put your hands up. Now the hand on your left? That goes on the thing with all the keys that have letters on them. That‚Äôs called a keyboard.‚Äù You can imagine the rest.

He logged off after that match and told me to go practice on my own.

My other friends in school also played WoW but they never wanted to play with me. They didn‚Äôt like how everything was handed to me and how I inherited all my PvP skills from this guy.

Eventually we graduated. He went to college and got kicked out for playing too much WoW. I went to another country and was in another timezone completely, so we never kept in touch. Come Wrath of the Lich King, I made a Death Knight and mained DK ever since. I swapped from a PvP server to a RP server, and transferred his beloved 2‚Äôs rogue to the RP server. I also paid for a race change to Blood Elf, just to really spite him even though he probably doesn‚Äôt care anymore.

I haven‚Äôt played WoW since the launch of Battle For Azeroth. I haven‚Äôt talked with that friend since graduation. I tried to restart my WoW PvP ‚Äòcareer‚Äô and leveled a Frost Mage specifically to do 3‚Äôs with some coworkers. I find the way WoW works now is too prohibitive, I can‚Äôt even get a group to practice without showing my SSN and resume so I stopped playing.

I played every expansion since BC. I liked most of them, but I remember my time during BC the most clearly. My friend and I had really good times. We Trick or Treated throughout Azeroth together on our mounts without using FPs and take screenshots at certain spots. He would call me up every time our guild had a big raid event and made sure I got a spot, and celebrate the shit out me getting any loot and raising my iLvl. Winning felt super good in 2s. But clearly all of this intensity left enough of an influence where I‚Äôm writing this book on reddit to talk about it. I'm not mad or upset about how I started WoW. After all these years, if I were to relive these experiences again I would just tell this guy to go flunk another college. I attribute all my PvP skill to him from this point in time. He taught me what it took to be ‚Äúgood.‚Äù But every time I‚Äôm in a competitive match, I can‚Äôt help but remember the Undercity arena.

At least I learned my left hand goes on a keyboard, and my right goes on a mouse.",1570079696.0,"How my friend got me into WoW to be his personal 2s partner in Burning CrusadeHi.

He was the meanest person I knew and everybody else thought he was super cool because of how mean he was. He made a few kids transfer, and I always felt guilty that I took part in the bullying because I didn‚Äôt want him to pick on me.

One day while we were on a school trip, he brought his laptop and bought me a WoW account. He told me to play a Troll rogue even though I thought Blood Elves were cooler. (Yeah I know BE‚Äôs are for weebs) I remember it was pretty fun. So when we got back from the trip, I started playing WoW with him and he carried me throughout the game. He would buy BoE gear for my character so we could do BG‚Äôs at 20, 30, 40 etc. He invited me to the top guild in the server. We were on Skype everyday, doing every dungeon and seeing my character get all this sweet blue gear with sick enchants on them. Whenever we were questing and I would run into someone my level, he told me to duel them. Hunters were always stupid to duel against, but I did it anyways.

One time at Silithus, I was leveling on my own and a lvl 70 alliance dude found me and killed me. No big deal, it‚Äôs a PvP server and I‚Äôm used to it. I mentioned I was killed on Skype, and my friend instantly asks where I am and what class is the dude. Within moments he rides up with his mage and smokes the dude who killed me. That guy calls out his guild, and my friend and I fight off his guild. My friend was one of the top 5 mages in the battlegroup, so he was basically carrying me in this fight. We kept dying but coming back up and taking more of them down.

Once I reached 70, there would be days after school he would tell me to sit outside Org and fight everyone I see, and he would watch and tell me after what I should have done. His goal was he needed a rogue to do 2‚Äôs with him all the time, and all the carrying and practicing lead to this goal. I remember doing 2v2‚Äôs with him was the worst, because I obviously wasn‚Äôt top 5 battlegroup tier. Specifically there was one match in the Undercity Arena, where in the middle of the match where he was barraging me with questions on why I‚Äôm so shitty he told me this:

‚ÄúStop stop stop stop. Stop everything you‚Äôre doing. Just stop. Put your hands up. Now the hand on your left? That goes on the thing with all the keys that have letters on them. That‚Äôs called a keyboard.‚Äù You can imagine the rest.

He logged off after that match and told me to go practice on my own.

My other friends in school also played WoW but they never wanted to play with me. They didn‚Äôt like how everything was handed to me and how I inherited all my PvP skills from this guy.

Eventually we graduated. He went to college and got kicked out for playing too much WoW. I went to another country and was in another timezone completely, so we never kept in touch. Come Wrath of the Lich King, I made a Death Knight and mained DK ever since. I swapped from a PvP server to a RP server, and transferred his beloved 2‚Äôs rogue to the RP server. I also paid for a race change to Blood Elf, just to really spite him even though he probably doesn‚Äôt care anymore.

I haven‚Äôt played WoW since the launch of Battle For Azeroth. I haven‚Äôt talked with that friend since graduation. I tried to restart my WoW PvP ‚Äòcareer‚Äô and leveled a Frost Mage specifically to do 3‚Äôs with some coworkers. I find the way WoW works now is too prohibitive, I can‚Äôt even get a group to practice without showing my SSN and resume so I stopped playing.

I played every expansion since BC. I liked most of them, but I remember my time during BC the most clearly. My friend and I had really good times. We Trick or Treated throughout Azeroth together on our mounts without using FPs and take screenshots at certain spots. He would call me up every time our guild had a big raid event and made sure I got a spot, and celebrate the shit out me getting any loot and raising my iLvl. Winning felt super good in 2s. But clearly all of this intensity left enough of an influence where I‚Äôm writing this book on reddit to talk about it. I'm not mad or upset about how I started WoW. After all these years, if I were to relive these experiences again I would just tell this guy to go flunk another college. I attribute all my PvP skill to him from this point in time. He taught me what it took to be ‚Äúgood.‚Äù But every time I‚Äôm in a competitive match, I can‚Äôt help but remember the Undercity arena.

At least I learned my left hand goes on a keyboard, and my right goes on a mouse.",1

3564,State of the Factions come 9.0?,"After playing through the last leg of the war campaign a couple of times I got to thinking, like a lot of people have done what the status of the factions will be in a 9.0 world and I thought I'd share my ideas and see what you all think.

Personally, I don't believe the factions will be completely removed. I think that's a step too far. Certainly there would be some cross play but ultimately, I think the factions will act, more or less, as they do now.

Firstly, whenever you make an Orc, it will be a part of the Horde. That orc, as you play with it and level it up will be able to group with Alliance for dungeons (and later raids), but otherwise would be a member of the Horde. Communication with the Alliance would be possible in places.

In PvP, it will be a member of the Horde. In war mode it will fight alongside other members of the Horde.

He'll be able to go to Orgrimmar, as/when needed but also Stormwind and Ironforge. He may not have any flight points that will take him to Boralus for example, but he can still go there and he won't be attacked.

However, should he decide the Horde is not really for him, he would be able to go to an NPC and change to the Alliance. This won't change much, he'll still be able to do everything he's done before but it will allow him some benefits. He'll be able to use Alliance Flight points, he'll get access to alliance only mounts and pets/transmog, loosing access to the Horde one's he had previously. When he does PvP, he'll do so along other members of the Alliance. All this is also true for an alliance race who goes to the Horde.

However, I don't think this will be encouraged. I'd expect a sort of fee to change faction that increases every time you want to change with a fair cooldown. Just to stop people abusing it, becuase if it's something like this, people will find a way to abuse it.

I rolled a Shaman which was my main back in the day. A dwarf shaman this time! How cool is that? The animations are so good, even casting a different spell (lightning bolt vs lava ) looked completely different!

Played on release all the way to Burning Crusade and I quit playing around 2008 right before WoTLK. 

Fast forward until today and I tried out Classic about two weeks ago due to nostalgia mainly and I found it entertaining. However the experience was very similar to what I played before quitting and so I started to feel the fun/hype/nostalgia burn out the last couple of days.

I decided to try out Retail since its free with the sub anyway. Oh man, I am HOOKED. I am now 31 Years old married with kids and the game feels a lot more fun without being so hardcore. Leveling is much faster and there seems to be so much progression.

I rolled a Shaman which was my main back in the day. A dwarf shaman this time! How cool is that? The animations are so good, even casting a different spell (lightning bolt vs lava ) looked completely different!

# Developer Q&A

**Q: What do you think is the biggest challenge for a class in a raid?**

A: We like the idea of the tanking class, and we think it's a cool concept. It's not a problem we're solving, but we are working on it.

&#x200B;

**Q: What do you think is the biggest challenge for a character in the early stages of a level 90 character?**

A: We don't have any specific examples to share just yet, but we would like to share some of the reasons why we feel that certain skills and talents are less popular than others.

For example, talent specialization is a big part of the reason why we're not doing a ""holy paladin"" spec. We like to keep it as a choice, but we think it makes the game feel more like a lot of ""holy paladin"" players are still going to want to do the class. The class specialization system we're working on is a big part of that, and we like the way it feels. It's a cool idea, but it's one that we're not sure we're ready to commit to.

We do like the idea of specialization. It's an interesting idea, but it's one that doesn't fit the gameplay we want to have. It's something that we're constantly looking at, but it's one that isn't as easy as just throwing in a bunch of talents. We have some ideas that are coming up for how we'd like to make that happen, but they're not finished, and we're still working on it.

# Fake Tweets from the blues

*Classes*

**Well we're doing a lot of things wrong. Maybe we can fix it, maybe we can't fix it.**  
I think it's important to keep in mind that we're trying to fix it, but it's hard to do that in a way that doesn't make things worse. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**why not nerf Feral Shaman's taming in 10% dps to compensate for the lack of taming talent?**  
We don't think it's a big deal. We think it's a really fun ability. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Are we going to see a new talent for Shapeshift in WoD?**  
That's a cool idea. We just need to figure out how to make it fit. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Why is it that hunters are still able to do all their damage while tanking?**  
Because they're a lot more fun in PvP. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**I hate the way Hunter dps is too high. I like it when it is high, but I think it's a problem when it's low.**  
We have some ideas on how to fix that. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**How would you fix the Hunter dps problem?**  
It's not like we're going to make it the same way every spec. We're not going to do that, but we would like to make some changes. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**any plans to make Misdirection a buff in the future? I'm getting the feeling that it's just a bug now**   
It's a bug. It's just a fun one.

I'm not sure we're in a position to be able to give you any more details on that. We're still discussing. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**What's the difference between the 2 new Blackout Kick, it's still a stupid ability**  
It's a dumb ability. We're trying to get to the point where we don't need it. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Can you give us a hint as to when we can expect to see the new Shaman spell, Wild Mushroom?**  
It's in the game files. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**I can't imagine you guys are happy with the nerf to Shadow. I have always found it fun.**  
We don't think it was a great design. It was a mistake. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Why do the Druids get a nerf in the expansion? I love the flavor.**  
The flavor is great. It's just that it's just not in the game. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

&#x200B;

*Characters / Items*

**What's the point of the crafting system? I'd hate to be a slave to it.**  
I'd hate to be a slave to it. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**The new models are very nice. It's just a shame they're all just so boring.**  
We love the new models, but they just don't fit the game. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Can we get any more details on the new leveling system?**  
It's a leveling system. It'll be much easier to work with. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Will the new leveling system work on player level 100+ or will it be mandatory?**  
Both. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**With the new leveling system, what will we be able to earn?**  
You'll be able to earn a level 100+ character for free. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Why is the leveling system being removed from the game?**  
Because we don't think it's a good way for the game to have to constantly adjust and change to keep pace with player activity. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Can we get a sense of how often people use the leveling system to level their characters?**  
It's not a huge chunk of people, but it's definitely something that we're trying to increase. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

&#x200B;

*Game*

**Why are the new players always complaining about the old way of doing things?**  
Because it's not the way they wanted to do it.[@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Why does it take so much effort to make a new race?**  
Because we want them to be a viable choice. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**I'm a level 90, and I can't just type the numbers. I'm using my laptop. Is this the first time we see it?**  
Yes, it's the first time we see it. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Any chance of a ""quality of life"" button for Mists of Pandaria? It feels like it would be annoying to have to constantly have to re-adjust your stats to fit the new model.**  
We are considering it, but it's a tough decision. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Will the next tier of the PTR be a little bit more competitive with the previous tier? Because we're spending so much money on it**  
Definitely. The current tier is in a pretty good place. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

&#x200B;

*Story*

**Will we see more of the old shaman in the future?**  
Yes. WarcraftDevs

**Is the War Campaign a way to make the faction feel more unique?**  
It is. But if you're going to make it, we'd like to make it a bit more. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**'Curse of Naxxramas' Why are we doing this?**  
I don't think it's fair to give everyone a choice in what to do, it's a challenge. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**The new difficulty is not a reflection of the quality of the content.**  
It is. It's not the content. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**If you're still doing the content, why not put more in-depth content in the next expansion?**  
The new content is going to be a ton of fun and I'd love to do more. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

  
*PVP*

The old ones. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

# Developer Q&A

**Q: What do you think is the biggest challenge for a class in a raid?**

A: We like the idea of the tanking class, and we think it's a cool concept. It's not a problem we're solving, but we are working on it.

&#x200B;

**Q: What do you think is the biggest challenge for a character in the early stages of a level 90 character?**

A: We don't have any specific examples to share just yet, but we would like to share some of the reasons why we feel that certain skills and talents are less popular than others.

For example, talent specialization is a big part of the reason why we're not doing a ""holy paladin"" spec. We like to keep it as a choice, but we think it makes the game feel more like a lot of ""holy paladin"" players are still going to want to do the class. The class specialization system we're working on is a big part of that, and we like the way it feels. It's a cool idea, but it's one that we're not sure we're ready to commit to.

We do like the idea of specialization. It's an interesting idea, but it's one that doesn't fit the gameplay we want to have. It's something that we're constantly looking at, but it's one that isn't as easy as just throwing in a bunch of talents. We have some ideas that are coming up for how we'd like to make that happen, but they're not finished, and we're still working on it.

# Fake Tweets from the blues

*Classes*

**Well we're doing a lot of things wrong. Maybe we can fix it, maybe we can't fix it.**  
I think it's important to keep in mind that we're trying to fix it, but it's hard to do that in a way that doesn't make things worse. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**why not nerf Feral Shaman's taming in 10% dps to compensate for the lack of taming talent?**  
We don't think it's a big deal. We think it's a really fun ability. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Are we going to see a new talent for Shapeshift in WoD?**  
That's a cool idea. We just need to figure out how to make it fit. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Why is it that hunters are still able to do all their damage while tanking?**  
Because they're a lot more fun in PvP. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**I hate the way Hunter dps is too high. I like it when it is high, but I think it's a problem when it's low.**  
We have some ideas on how to fix that. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**How would you fix the Hunter dps problem?**  
It's not like we're going to make it the same way every spec. We're not going to do that, but we would like to make some changes. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**any plans to make Misdirection a buff in the future? I'm getting the feeling that it's just a bug now**   
It's a bug. It's just a fun one.

I'm not sure we're in a position to be able to give you any more details on that. We're still discussing. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**What's the difference between the 2 new Blackout Kick, it's still a stupid ability**  
It's a dumb ability. We're trying to get to the point where we don't need it. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Can you give us a hint as to when we can expect to see the new Shaman spell, Wild Mushroom?**  
It's in the game files. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**I can't imagine you guys are happy with the nerf to Shadow. I have always found it fun.**  
We don't think it was a great design. It was a mistake. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Why do the Druids get a nerf in the expansion? I love the flavor.**  
The flavor is great. It's just that it's just not in the game. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

&#x200B;

*Characters / Items*

**What's the point of the crafting system? I'd hate to be a slave to it.**  
I'd hate to be a slave to it. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**The new models are very nice. It's just a shame they're all just so boring.**  
We love the new models, but they just don't fit the game. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Can we get any more details on the new leveling system?**  
It's a leveling system. It'll be much easier to work with. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Will the new leveling system work on player level 100+ or will it be mandatory?**  
Both. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**With the new leveling system, what will we be able to earn?**  
You'll be able to earn a level 100+ character for free. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Why is the leveling system being removed from the game?**  
Because we don't think it's a good way for the game to have to constantly adjust and change to keep pace with player activity. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Can we get a sense of how often people use the leveling system to level their characters?**  
It's not a huge chunk of people, but it's definitely something that we're trying to increase. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

&#x200B;

*Game*

**Why are the new players always complaining about the old way of doing things?**  
Because it's not the way they wanted to do it.[@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Why does it take so much effort to make a new race?**  
Because we want them to be a viable choice. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**I'm a level 90, and I can't just type the numbers. I'm using my laptop. Is this the first time we see it?**  
Yes, it's the first time we see it. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Any chance of a ""quality of life"" button for Mists of Pandaria? It feels like it would be annoying to have to constantly have to re-adjust your stats to fit the new model.**  
We are considering it, but it's a tough decision. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Will the next tier of the PTR be a little bit more competitive with the previous tier? Because we're spending so much money on it**  
Definitely. The current tier is in a pretty good place. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

&#x200B;

*Story*

**Will we see more of the old shaman in the future?**  
Yes. WarcraftDevs

**Is the War Campaign a way to make the faction feel more unique?**  
It is. But if you're going to make it, we'd like to make it a bit more. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**'Curse of Naxxramas' Why are we doing this?**  
I don't think it's fair to give everyone a choice in what to do, it's a challenge. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**The new difficulty is not a reflection of the quality of the content.**  
It is. It's not the content. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**If you're still doing the content, why not put more in-depth content in the next expansion?**  
The new content is going to be a ton of fun and I'd love to do more. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

  
*PVP*

**We're always interested to hear feedback about PvP. It's the reason why we don't have a lot of it in the game. We have a lot of ideas we are working on but we don't have anything ready to share just yet.** [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

3742,Zandalari Rep - Help?,"I'm 1/2 to exalted Zandalari rep (currently 10k revered rep).

Finished all Zuldazar quests as well as the war campaign. I only know of three ways to earn more rep: 1) World Quests (only give 75 rep + 10 with contract), 2) Emissary Quests (1500 rep but only pops every other day or so), 3) Flotsam items for Jani to buy (250 rep each).

Only about 5 world quests pop per day, which makes it 425 rep per day (with contract). Emissary quests maybe twice a week for 3k rep per week. Seafarer dubloons have a chance to drop in Island Expeditions, but at most 12 per run. Since each flotsam costs 100 dubloons, you'd need a fair amount of runs to earn even one flotsam.

Does anyone have a faster way to do this? Even at 1/2 to exalted, it seems like it'll take another 2-3 weeks to unlock Zandalari trolls (which are blocked by a whopping 14 quests after hitting exalted).

Any help would be appreciated.

First thing we noticed is that i have rejuv on for the entire duration, but log reveal it healed me for a total of 16k over the MC duration, which is nowhere near the healing i am recieving.  
Maybe rejuv gets crazy buffed by being MC, but logs don't show it, but then this would be a problem for all groups running WM with a resto druid.

Other than that, we could think that maybe leech stat is snapshot when mind controlled, meaning the 900+ leech from my lucid would stay and my big ignite ticks would heal me, but this is something we were not able to confirm.

As a side note, during this time DH did about 400k damage to me and the spriest close to 100k, so it is no small healing coming out.

7pm is race start time, so show up early, get a guild invite to one of our many guilds, hang out with community for a good cause, and meet your fellow Gnomies! Be sure to bring your S.E.L.F.I.E camera!


##Running of the Gnomes will benefit The Pink Fund, a group committed to providing financial support to help meet basic needs, decrease stress levels and allow breast cancer patients in active treatment focus on healing while improving survivorship outcomes. 

This includes vital things like housing, utilities, transportation and even help with insurance. You can find more information on [their site](https://www.pinkfund.org/about/our-mission/) or [their annual report.](https://imgur.com/a/0ir0Mkd)
 
#[Here is the donation link for the charity for this year.](https://thepinkfund.kindful.com/the-running-of-the-gnomes--2019) We‚Äôve set the goal at a very modest $5,000, but it would be amazing if we could double the amount for the charity.

##What is this? Is it just the in game micro-holiday?

Running of the Gnomes is an event where the whole of the Warcraft community gathers on one singular server, Scarlet Crusade, and travels from the Gnome starting zone to Booty Bay to help raise awareness and funds for Breast Cancer.

The yearly migration was so popular with players and the community that Blizzard honored the event with a Micro-Holiday called the Great Gnomeregan Race that occurs yearly on the same date worldwide. The micro holiday provides players with a race course, and NPCs to cheer them on.
 
**While the Micro-Holiday occurs everywhere, the community and gathering of players is still held on only on Scarlet Crusade-US.**
 
The community event benefits a charity we love, and gathers together people worldwide. At the start of the event in 2017, there were over 7,000 players online and $16,600+ raised, and $7,000+ in 2018!
 
##How to participate:

Simply log in on the specificid day on Scarlet Crusade, before the run start time and join us for the run, we‚Äôll have the invites, and you just need to bring yourself!
Because the Gnome Run is very popular, I suggest showing up not 10 minutes before the run if you can help it, or joining our discord for days that we are pre-inviting people to guilds to snag an invite early.


**There will be absolutely no Cross Realm invites for this.You must be on Scarlet Crusade or it‚Äôs connected realm Feathermoon.**I‚Äôm unable to facilitate people who are off realm. Simply roll a new character on the specified server and join in the fun that way!


If you do not play World of Warcraft, or play in the EU/Asia regions, you can download and use a US trial account. If your account is currently not active, you can also do the same! Trial accounts cannot join guilds, but you can run along with us, and we do have some ways to count you all. You can also join our discord still!

##A note about Racing Guilds:

We ask that even while it‚Äôs hectic, or there‚Äôs multiple guilds, we ask that you only join the guilds we‚Äôve confirmed for a variety of reasons:

We use the guilds to give out directions during the run, we don‚Äôt want people to have unexpectedly negative experiences in a random guild, or be scammed with a false donation link, we do use them to have some idea of how many people are at the event.
 
So far we can confirm for Live:

>Gnomes Race for a Cure

> Gnomes Race Too

> Gnome Three Racers

> Gnomes Race Four Us All

> Gnome Run Strikes Back

> Gnome and the Furious Six

> All Gnomes go to Seven

> The Last Gnome Run

> War for the Gnome Run

>Gnome with the Pink Run

> Gnomes to Eleven

**We have not yet picked Classic's Guild names. We are open to Suggestions, we love number based puns involving the word Gnomes and obvious themeing.**
 
More guilds will be announced on our social media and discords.
 
 
**Whispering those of us spamming chat with instructions to do so the exact word INVITE will auto trigger our addon (thanks to Ellypse for making it!) to get you a guild invite unless you have a trial account.**
 
 
##Why Gnomes?

Gnomes are one of the few races with pink hair, making it easy for everyone to coordinate. They also fit the idea of something ‚ÄúSmall‚Äù together adding up to something big when together.


##What about Tabards?

In Classic we should be able to trade them because of No Changes!


Live Side, Tabards were made BoP in Legion. You can buy them in Ironforge for less than 1g or you can mail yourself an Heirloom tabard from your other characters.


##After Party?


Yes! We always head to Orgrimmar afterwards to give out kisses and licks to current the head of the capitol!  (Who the heck is in charge currently??)
‚Ä¶We‚Äôve licked a lot of Horde leaders over the last 10 years to be honest.


##Why Breast Cancer, isn‚Äôt there a ton of attention for this already?


October is breast cancer awareness month. We understand we‚Äôre sugar coating something devastating for people with cute gnomes to open up a conversation, but for a good reason. Everyone‚Äôs been affected by cancer of some form. Plus, we really realize that breast cancer isn‚Äôt just a woman‚Äôs issue. It affects our moms, our sisters, but also our dads, our brothers, our friends, guildies, coworkers, and many other people in our lives. It‚Äôs affected people that we really love in our community.


We feel even if the pink hair and cute outfits or all these Gnomes remind just one single person to check themselves to get a mammogram or encourage that family member who hears to go in to the doctor who‚Äôs been putting it off we‚Äôve done our job for the year.


Plus it‚Äôs really hard to miss thousands of Gnomes doing anything, let alone thousands of Gnomes with the same colored hair stampeding through half a continent. Even out of game it gets people talking for a day or two.
 
##Do I have to be level 1?
 
No be whatever you want. Heck be Horde but you might be kinda lonely? 


##Can you Invite me Cross Server?


No, P L E A S E  just roll a Gnome on the server.

The Gnomes are all very low levels,and the few high level helpers we are bringing are using group invites to help lost Gnomes as they can. I won‚Äôt do this for anyone, and please don‚Äôt ask anyone to, as they‚Äôll wind up without anyone, and upset/stressed out at

##Pets/Toys/Mounts?


I can‚Äôt tell you guys not to use any of these things, but let‚Äôs try to keep the server afloat!


Keep in mind that there will be a lot of you all in one place at once.  The more toys, pets, mounts you use, the worse it will be.


However it‚Äôs not your job to yell at people to put them away. In fact, using /yell isn‚Äôt helpful either. It only makes the lag worse.


The ‚ÄúRace‚Äù isn‚Äôt about who gets there first, and people who use the Heirloom Mounts tend to get jumped on by wild creatures as they get ahead of the pack. They also cause a lot of lag client side. If you wanted to ride a mount, the Riding Turtle is perfect for a low level character, as it‚Äôs fun but doesn‚Äôt get you there any faster.

 
##Can I level my character first or reuse my old character from previous years?

Of course! We say roll a level 1, but it‚Äôs only a suggestion. You can use whatever character you would like. Some people roll Death Knights, but you have to be certain you‚Äôve completed the starting zone because Arthas is clingy and won‚Äôt let go of our soul.  


However don‚Äôt worry about leveling one to make it easier. It being hard is fun for some people too.


The character only need be on the Scarlet Crusade-Feathermoon Cluster or on Bloodsail. See the same answer about high level characters on Scarlet Crusade.


##I only have a trial account is that okay?


On Classic no. But on Live? YES! The only thing is that you cannot join the Gnome racing guilds. That‚Äôs okay though, because once the run starts, we turn off guild chat to help people not get so lost. You will still be able to come along.


We have a way to account for you, so don‚Äôt stress out! We do encourage you to enjoy our discord and everything else as well!
 
##Is there an EU/Asia Realms Version?


Unfortunately no. Since we‚Äôre using the Micro-holiday‚Äôs set up, and the Gnome Run is an involved event that requires us in the starting zone off and on for 36 hours straight, we wouldn‚Äôt have the time to pull off a second or third one in that time frame. And on Classic it's about everyone having a subscription and time and everything else. 


Also my ability to speak most languages for any Asia realms isn‚Äôt fluent enough to run an entire event on any of the realms in question.
If you are a player from another region, you can simply download the US trial version and run along with us to participate! We have a good handful of players from other regions every year!


I can‚Äôt attend but will there be a stream/video?:



Not officially yet, but there‚Äôs always amazing videos created by the community members that we are happy to share.

If you are interested in streaming the run, please do! It‚Äôs a great way for people to partake if they can‚Äôt attend.


However we must very firmly ask that you remove personal donation links from your Twitch or other streaming services during the run, and put up a link to The Pink Fund, so that other people do not think they are donating to a charity, when they are really donating to you.


##Where are you guys running?

Wowhead made a video of the early PTR‚Äôs version of our race course!:  https://youtu.be/aqqwlJOl9DA

Also from the Dwarven/Gnome Starting area on Classic.
 
 
 
##I want to help with the run!


Tell your friends! Reshare our information on various social media platforms, turn your guild‚Äôs tabards pink and tell people why. Force your friends to come with you.
Feel free to send a donation of the materials for a Pink Mageweave shirt to help clothe a brand new Gnome in need to Meiousei on Scarlet Crusade.

However it‚Äôs not your job to yell at people to put them away. In fact, using /yell isn‚Äôt helpful either. It only makes the lag worse.


The ‚ÄúRace‚Äù isn‚Äôt about who gets there first, and people who use the Heirloom Mounts tend to get jumped on by wild creatures as they get ahead of the pack. They also cause a lot of lag client side. If you wanted to ride a mount, the Riding Turtle is perfect for a low level character, as it‚Äôs fun but doesn‚Äôt get you there any faster.

 
##Can I level my character first or reuse my old character from previous years?

Of course! We say roll a level 1, but it‚Äôs only a suggestion. You can use whatever character you would like. Some people roll Death Knights, but you have to be certain you‚Äôve completed the starting zone because Arthas is clingy and won‚Äôt let go of our soul.  


However don‚Äôt worry about leveling one to make it easier. It being hard is fun for some people too.


The character only need be on the Scarlet Crusade-Feathermoon Cluster or on Bloodsail. See the same answer about high level characters on Scarlet Crusade.


##I only have a trial account is that okay?


On Classic no. But on Live? YES! The only thing is that you cannot join the Gnome racing guilds. That‚Äôs okay though, because once the run starts, we turn off guild chat to help people not get so lost. You will still be able to come along.


We have a way to account for you, so don‚Äôt stress out! We do encourage you to enjoy our discord and everything else as well!
 
##Is there an EU/Asia Realms Version?


Unfortunately no. Since we‚Äôre using the Micro-holiday‚Äôs set up, and the Gnome Run is an involved event that requires us in the starting zone off and on for 36 hours straight, we wouldn‚Äôt have the time to pull off a second or third one in that time frame. And on Classic it's about everyone having a subscription and time and everything else. 


Also my ability to speak most languages for any Asia realms isn‚Äôt fluent enough to run an entire event on any of the realms in question.
If you are a player from another region, you can simply download the US trial version and run along with us to participate! We have a good handful of players from other regions every year!


I can‚Äôt attend but will there be a stream/video?:



Not officially yet, but there‚Äôs always amazing videos created by the community members that we are happy to share.

If you are interested in streaming the run, please do! It‚Äôs a great way for people to partake if they can‚Äôt attend.


However we must very firmly ask that you remove personal donation links from your Twitch or other streaming services during the run, and put up a link to The Pink Fund, so that other people do not think they are donating to a charity, when they are really donating to you.


##Where are you guys running?

Wowhead made a video of the early PTR‚Äôs version of our race course!:  https://youtu.be/aqqwlJOl9DA

Also from the Dwarven/Gnome Starting area on Classic.
 
 
 
##I want to help with the run!


Tell your friends! Reshare our information on various social media platforms, turn your guild‚Äôs tabards pink and tell people why. Force your friends to come with you.
Feel free to send a donation of the materials for a Pink Mageweave shirt to help clothe a brand new Gnome in need to Meiousei on Scarlet Crusade.
If you have another idea you can tweet at me @Dravvie, or leave me a message here. I‚Äôm open to ideas, as long as it doesn‚Äôt lead to complete chaos!",1

Recently I bought a 27-inches iMac with Radeon Pro 580X. When I play WoW with max graphic settings, I notice the FPS is really low, like \~15FPS on an empty spot in Durotar. I did research and found the Easyres solution but it only improved by \~3FPS. It is quite unplayable.

What can I do to fix the problem? Or it is just impossible to max out WoW on my Mac?

I'm not looking to get back into it full-time, as I don't have the time. Maybe a couple hours a day or every second day. (Depending if I get a satisfactory amount of work finished).


Now my question: Is there a guide to accessing WoW on a public network that has the ports blocked? Or someome that could take me through it?

I believe? But did not stay long. Garrison life was lame. I have been playing ESO since 2014 and was a GM of a 100+ person trial/raiding guild but quit the game due to being burned out.

Experience in Classic WoW:

I played EQ back in the day so starting WoW Classic has been a wonderful experience. I am now a 22 Orc Warrior tank on a PVP server and have been running through WC and learning so much about the game. I love how difficult it is and how I actually learn about the lore and landscape of the land through quests and adventuring. I also enjoy how nice everyone is and how grouping and interacting with others has been. I feel as if the world is huge and mysterious. I also feel as if I have a unique class identity.  


Experience in modern WoW

Last night I felt like I wanted to try modern WoW to see the differences. So I downloaded the game and made another Orc Warrior. The animation graphics while fighting were amazing! It also seems like our characters run faster? I see now in modern WoW there is no option to interact with a class trainer? I just get the spells/skills automatically? I don't understand why everything is just given to you instead of being earned and paid for. While doing quest and fighting it seemed as if I was just gliding through content with little to no thought or sense of danger at all. The starter areas were also massively empty compared to Classic. My Orc Warrior in WoW is just level 4 currently but I will keep playing it more to see if things improve.

&#x200B;

Conclusion thus far: Classic WoW provides the difficulty I think alot of players miss in MMO's. Modern games make an error in giving everything to the players for free. Things should be earned. Death and failing should be a part of the game. Things should not be easy. I think if modern WoW would bring back individuality to the classes and increased the difficulty of things and made adventuring a unique and mysterious thing WHILE keeping the modern things such as new animations/graphics/QoL stuff modern WoW would be amazing! Finally, modern WoW seems to be missing that aspect of interaction with other players. I think if all these aforementioned were added into WoW it would be fantastic! Since I have started playing classic WoW, it's all I ever think about while at work. This game is 10 x better than ESO.

While doing quest and fighting it seemed as if I was just gliding through content with little to no thought or sense of danger at all. The starter areas were also massively empty compared to Classic. My Orc Warrior in WoW is just level 4 currently but I will keep playing it more to see if things improve.

&#x200B;

Conclusion thus far: Classic WoW provides the difficulty I think alot of players miss in MMO's. Modern games make an error in giving everything to the players for free. Things should be earned. Death and failing should be a part of the game. Things should not be easy. I think if modern WoW would bring back individuality to the classes and increased the difficulty of things and made adventuring a unique and mysterious thing WHILE keeping the modern things such as new animations/graphics/QoL stuff modern WoW would be amazing! Finally, modern WoW seems to be missing that aspect of interaction with other players. I think if all these aforementioned were added into WoW it would be fantastic! Since I have started playing classic WoW, it's all I ever think about while at work. This game is 10 x better than ESO. Just my thoughts.",1

But I got out off it after someone told me that I wasn't a true warcraft player if I didnt ever pay money to play the full version, and that the full version was the only way to continue on with the story, because you had to constantly pay money to JUST to get to certain areas, parts of story, and get past level 20 (sort of like a bad(IMO) MPRPG that my brother played with the title having to do with mages)

So I left WoW. But now I here of classic WoW, and want to know is it worth getting the classic WoW FREE version, and would I be considered to be a wow player, even though I don't have the constantly to pay for full version?

3863,If your WoW Client won't update today... 10/01/2019 [FIXED],"Hello everyone.

&#x200B;

I had an odd issue this morning, as I saw I had to update my client via the [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) app.  However attempting to update it gave me an error: "" Whoops! Looks like something broke. Give it another shot -  BLZBNTAGT00000BB8""   


So I followed the steps on Blizz's website, restarted [Battle.net](https://Battle.net), uninstalled WoW Client (after backing-up my addons and so on) but now I can't even install WoW!  Strange.

So I go about manually deleting the WoW Folder and then I notice three files that claim to be ""in use"" - note my [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) app is not running and WoW is not even installed fully on the PC at the moment.  

The Three files in question are, oddly ""WoW Voice Proxy"" - specially the .exe ""WowVoiceProxy.""  


For those who MIGHT have the same issue (I'm still confused why the WoW Voice Proxy was running without WoW or [B.net](https://B.net) running... but...) just go to task manager, sort by your program name, and kill that process.    


From there you should be able to install the update -- no need to reinstall the [b.net](https://b.net) app or the main client like I did.

&#x200B;

So, tl;dr: If you cannot install or update the client today, make sure ""WowVoiceProxy.exe"" isn't running in the background via Task Manager.  Once you kill it, update/install works perfectly.

&#x200B;

Hope this helps someone!",1569965049.0,"If your WoW Client won't update today... 10/01/2019 [FIXED]Hello everyone.

3870,It's Official! I am hooked.,"So, my husband got me in to playing WoW back in WoD. I tried a warrior, hated it and stopped playing. WoW was the first ever computer MMORPG game i ever played. Started playing it after playing Diablo 3 for a year. So the controls were way different. Legion comes out and now I am even more intrigued. My husband said to pick a class, suggested beast master hunter (horde side of course), and that he would create the same character and play with me. He really showed me a lot and was very patient. Loved it. Got the character to 120 with BoA release. I even have been working on the loremaster achievement. Got a level 120 alliance character only to get the achievement that awards 2 mounts. lol.

Anyways, WoW classic came out. I was super hyped because it gave me the opportunity to see the zones before Cataclysm changed everything. Classic has been awesome! Been enjoying seeing the zones how they once were. Well, the 8.2.5 patch came out. So last night, we decided to play retail and finish out the war campaign. I had chosen to side with Saurfang back on the original quest line. My husband chose to side with Sylvannas. So we have been watching each other to see how both sides played out. Last night, I am watching the final cinematic, I am balling. and it hit me...""I love this game!"" I was so emotional over the characters. I want more.

BFA has a lot of new systems and gearing sources, and I can't find a comprehensive list of things that need to be completed.  My aim for now is to gear up to the level of getting into normal, then HC pugs (and push some M+ keys).

General gear drops: I've been doing the WQs that drop gear, then the ones where the emissary gives gear upgrades, also LFR to get some pieces.  I've done the into Nag questline to unlock the Benthic system, and the Mech quetline to just unlock the island for the dungeon.  Do I just stay in Nag and grind all possible content to roll the dice and upgrade the good pieces?

Essences: I've found the BiS essences for my spec.  Should I only bother with the epic version of each?  The BiS one is a epic that is a boss drop, or a rare that is a reward for for a mission table.  My followers are all basic, not levelled up.   
 Should I bother with that version and thus the follower table?  Seems like a lot of time investment if the epic will just drop in next week's LFR.  I also don't want to invest time in the mission table if this patch has made it redundant somehow.

Reputation: How important is the rep grind/ faction war campaigns this late in the exp?  I do want pathfinder and I think it's tied to that in some way, but would you do that RATHER than spend time in Nag grind for Benthic items?

Essences: I've found the BiS essences for my spec.  Should I only bother with the epic version of each?  The BiS one is a epic that is a boss drop, or a rare that is a reward for for a mission table.  My followers are all basic, not levelled up.   
 Should I bother with that version and thus the follower table?  Seems like a lot of time investment if the epic will just drop in next week's LFR.  I also don't want to invest time in the mission table if this patch has made it redundant somehow.

Reputation: How important is the rep grind/ faction war campaigns this late in the exp?  I do want pathfinder and I think it's tied to that in some way, but would you do that RATHER than spend time in Nag grind for Benthic items?

General: Have I missed an obvious route to character progression that I should be focusing on?  There are so many systems that feel hidden in BFA it's hard for a returning vet to get his head around!

Thanks for any help.",1

3897,Imagining WoW with your dream ideas! Things that would never be implemented but doesnt stop you from dreaming! (Incl mine),"This is purely imaginary discussion!
In this conversation we aren't talking logistics of how it would work, just fun ideas that you could only dream of having in the game!

I had this one today in the shower.

Imagine after Vanilla each expansion pack created 2 new factions for the new zones, WotLK for example, introducing 2 factions with 2 different stories for Northrend only, for and against the main protagonist. All players would get a choice regardless of previous faction.

This is where it can get iffy speculating how it would work, especially with lore and previous xpacs so I dont really want to talk much about that technicalities, but any smart ideas on how this could of worked would be fun to read!

In WotLK players get to choose whether to serve the Scourge or the Argent Crusade, and in raids like ICC for example they could be identical but roles reversed. One vs LK as the one we already know. But for the other faction a reskin of the same fights but for Tirion fordring, and other notable characters. 

I too am thinking of all the ways this would go horribly wrong! Especially lore wise and mere mountainous tasks for developers, but what's your take, what would you of loved to see happen outside of real life constrictions, what were you're crazy wishlists full of when you had your highs with this game?",1569949836.0,"Imagining WoW with your dream ideas!

3911,Playing WoW for the lore,"I just bought BFA and I'm trying to figure out the best way to play through the game to get as much lore as possible. If the research I've done is correct, Cataclysm revamped the early leveling experience so 1-60 is Cataclysm stuff, once you hit 60 you get the opportunity to choose between Burning Crusade or Lich King content, then go back to Cataclysm for high level content, then move on to Pandaria, Draenor, Legion, and of course, BFA.

Also, if I choose Burning Crusade, will I then be able to choose to play Lich King/Northrend content afterward? I picked WoW up because of/for the lore, so I'm trying to experience everything I can in-game before I head to Youtube.

It‚Äôs likely Sylvanas and Anduin are going to be the 2019 Blizzcon pets‚Ä¶ but in murloc form. We will probably find out tomorrow. (1st October)  
Earlier in September they announced the virtual ticket will go on sale in October and I assume they will want to get the virtual ticket on the store ASAP as there isn‚Äôt much time left before Blizzcon now.

I mean it could be the 9.0 collectors edition pet‚Ä¶ but 99% of the time murloc pets are related to Blizzcon.",1

3938,My belief on what a Mak'gora is.,"A lot of people argue about what the Mak'gora is and my guild mates are no different and what is cheating and what isn't. Now you don't half to agree with me this is just what I kinda put together from the Lore i've been reading about. So feel free to tell me some of your reasonings in the comments I would love to see some other peoples perspectives on it. This is just how I belief a Mak'gora is defined. ""I tried to put the challenger first in the vs.""  


 Mak'gora is pretty much a broad term used to describe a fight ""More often than not to the death"". it's rules depend of the combatants who are fighting. Thrall reinstilled Mak'gora as a non-lethal sport rather than a fight to the death. plus you can refuse a Mak'gora but it comes with dishonor which is why they never refuse. Sylvanas could have refused if she so choosed.  


Example of the rules are like with Cairne vs Garrosh they agreed on the use of only 1 weapon, a blessing of the weapon by a shaman of their choosing ""Which has never been seen before or after so may have been Tauren addition to the tradition"", armor and clothing was forbidden only a loincloth was allowed. Each participant must have at least 1 witness and it was to the death for leadership of the Horde. While Garrosh vs Thrall the first time around armor was fully permitted with the players being the witnesses and magic seemed to be allowed and it wasn't a fight to the death.  


Some Mak'gora have the use of Magic and weapons as legal while others do not the first every seen ingame Mak'gora was the modern version with Garrosh vs Thrall (as mentioned before) right before the lich king attacked.""Thrall casted Lightning bolts"" which is why I believe magic was allowed but it could have simply just been that was the ability rotation of the NPC, as well as weapons and armor on the models and it wasn't a fight to the death.  


the first seen was Orgrim vs Blackhand (Main Timeline) where the two orcs painted themselves with clan symbols and adorned in oil, they dueled for hours. with Orgrim crushing Blackhand's skull with Doomhammer.  


The most controversial Mak'gora was Thrall vs Garrosh (round 2) it seemed the use of magic was allowed even tho people argue that Thrall cheated Which since Garrosh was a warrior and couldn't use magic might have been the case but there has never been the official rule of no magic but it would seem that fighting for leadership specifically seems to be non magical but it could be coincidence perhaps its allowed but Orc soldiers rather see a leader win with skill and force then the ""Weaker/cheating"" magic way. Like with the Warcraft movie Gul'dan vs Durotan and the Sylvanas vs Saurfang example it would seem fair but you take into account that Mak'gora is a fight to the death and some aren't very physically strong like if you put a Mage vs Warrior with no magic allowed the warrior would rekt that mages face unless he could use magic and Warriors do beat magic users just as Magic users beat warriors.  


So a Mak'gora should just be defined as a fight that the combatants choose the rules of Magic, Weapons, Armor and even to the Death not just ""oh he said Mak'gora that means if it's not like that other Mak'gora I saw it means he cheated"" I think the Warcraft movie one was just entertainment wise and shouldn't be considered canon ""The Rules"" unless they say it was the rules Gul'dan and Durotan chose.

3952,Was Blizzard's attempt at NG+ successful?,"TLDR: Yes, but it could have been better.

Allied races are arguably Blizzard's biggest attempt at adding NG+ content to WoW.  With only being able to unlock them at max level and the emphasis on playing the new races through the leveling process (required to unlock heritage armor) rather than using a boost, Allied Races were Blizzards first attempt to add unlockable features to the game.

Many other notable games and MMOs have done this as well, notably SWTOR offered the ability to have certain races available to other classes once you'd leveled one to the level cap, and FFXIV offered some content like this as well.  However, for many people playing WoW the idea of having to unlock a new race, especially ones gated with weeks of reputation grinding, was not a welcome addition to the game.

I think part of the reasoning for the lukewarm reception of this content had to do with the fact that Blizzard didn't market Allied races as NG+ content.  Rather they pushed them as brand new races like they had in previous expansions.  The problem with this was that for one, they were not exactly new races, with many being slight reskins of old races, and they were not available upon picking up the expansion as previous new races were.

Instead of telling the players, ""Hey, this is NG+ content to encourage you to go a back and enjoy the leveling and exploration of the old world and will give life and longevity to the game,"" Blizzard doubled down on the whole ""NEW RACES"" marketing, and many players didn't correctly identify it as such on their own. 

It even seemed as if Blizzard was unsure if NG+ was actually the goal of Allied Races or not themselves at times.  While Dark Irons, Maghar, Lightforged, and Highmountain customizations were just mostly reskins of existing races, and Void Elves and Nightborn offered cross faction options, Zandalari and Kul'Tirans had the entirety of the expansion's story built around them which made them feel much more fleshed out like traditional new races from previous expansions.

I believe if Blizzard had marketed Allied Races as NG+ content, they would have been much better received.  If they had done that they could have marketed Kul'Tirans and Zandalari as actual new races, and as a whole, both the Allied Races and new races would have been better received.  It was almost as if Bilzzard felt a bit guilty at offering Kul'Tirans and Zandalari as new races, and tried to cover it up with the whole Allied Race thing...

From a player perspective, NG+ Allied Races are a great addition to the game.  They could potentially keep new players from skipping previous expansion content as soon as they are able, and could be added to throughout WoW's history.  However, I worry that with the stale reception they received Blizzard will abandon the concept in the next expansion instead of adding further to it with more options people have been asking about got years, such as Taunka/Yangols, Wildhammers, San'layn, High Elves, etc...",1569920495.0,"Was Blizzard's attempt at NG+ successful?TLDR: Yes, but it could have been better.

Wow is 100% unplayable for me because I'm very picky about things like this and it feels like its making me sick every time i move the camera so any advice would be deeply appreciated.",1

WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON D.C. ‚Äì Today, April 2, 2015, marks the one-year anniversary of the Burning Crusade. The Burning Crusade was a massive success, earning Blizzard Entertainment‚Äîand subsequently, World of Warcraft‚Äîover 10 million unique players. Following the success of the Burning Crusade, Blizzard decided to take a fresh look at their Path of Exile system. They decided to change up the Order Lock system in Hearthstone, and added a fresh, new feature, Random Encrypted Matter.

The Random Encrypted Matter system is what makes the upcoming \[Grand Unified Planets\] unique. Grand Unified Planets is what makes all future expansions free-for-all, with each expansion requiring a unique lock to be obtained. As such, this plan was very important to us. Therefore, we're changing the system to allow players the chance to unify their Order Locks in one place, at anytime.

&#x200B;

INTRODUCING RAIDS

We wanted to present an updated, more fun way for raiding with friends new and old. That's why we're introducing Raid Finder, a new system that lets you queue for and join a raid of any size for any content type, at a moment's notice. Not on the same day, but at a moment's notice.

&#x200B;

RAIDS

TRAVELING IS NOW A THING

With the launch of Battle for Azeroth, we set out to make gearing your class or spec a little easier. To that end, we've made it so you don't need to grind through item level 1-10 to get the occasional item that might drop. You can now do all of the hard, time-consuming, role-specific work yourself, instead of having a team of people tell you what to do.

We're also pleased to announce that all 9-slot raid bags have been reduced to 5-slot configurations, so you can now take advantage of the reduced pricing we've seen with this new system. 5-slot systems are available for those raiding with four or more slots, 4-slot systems are available for those raiding with three or more slots, and 1-10 slot raid bags are available for those raiding with all of the required slots.

One major difference between this new system and the old system is that we've made it so you don't need to grind through item levels 1-10 to get items that might drop from random (non-boss) encounters. The end result is that you won't necessarily be broke if you drop an item in 10-slot (or even 1-10) RAID Finder (or any other random drop), but you won't be broke if you drop that same item in a normal raid either.

&#x200B;

RAID GUILDS

We've added the Riot Guard to the new Raid Finder (and the existing Raid Finder) as a means to reduce queue times. The Riot Guard can be found in the same raid frames as other raid-specific characters, but has a 100% chance to drop an item in Raid Finder difficulty (up from 50% chance).

&#x200B;

STORY AND WORLD

Many changes have been made to the story behind the cataclysm world events: the invasion of Kalimdor, the rise of the Burning Legion, and the War Campaign. These world events have been overhauled to provide a smoother transition into the War Campaign.

&#x200B;

NPC CHANGES

Many NPCs that are not supposed to be in the raid have been changed to appear in a raid, either by changing their color or their model. While this fixes an issue with previous patches, it also introduces an entirely new system of handling things in Raid Finder (which we call ‚ÄòCruisin' the Truest) difficulty. This new system makes all NPCs relative no more 'forbidden fruit.'

This world event also saw the addition of a new mechanic:

* All nearby players become invisible when \[Cruisin' the Truesteel\] is activated.
* The mechanic works exactly like a \[Collectronic Module\], except with a twist: when activated, it also causes the camera to be turned to that which drives the character‚Äôs thrusters, thus obscuring their actual location.

The hidden loot in this raid was that which dropped, not who dropped it. As such, it has been scaled back in value to be commensurate to the size of the reward.

&#x200B;

PROFESSIONS

Many new recipes have been added to assist players in obtaining the resources they need to power their raid.

* Many recipes in high demand by dungeon groups will now require significantly less \[Collectronic Module\] schematics to create.
* A new high-end profession that only players of the appropriate class can acquire is now available.
* Small but significant improvements have been made to many recipes in the high-end profession skill tree. Many of the recipes in this tree will be off-spec and thus unable to be applied to a non-

This is NOT about wanting the OLD (Legion&prior) Chaos Bolt Animation back, this is about wanting the Animation back the way it was in the Alpha/Beta of BfA.

In the Alpha/Beta the Chaos Bolt flew nicely out of the Hands of the Warlock, forming into its shape while flying, however on Retail it looks more like the Chaos Bolt is instantly formed and a good part of the tail from the Chaos Bolt appears BEHIND the Character, looking very off.

I have tried to post this on the EU forums a year ago, got some people that agreed but nothing has changed in the game. If someone could post this on the US Forums where the developers might see it I would be happy or maybe there is even a better way some of you know to contact some devs.

To better illustrate what I mean please watch the GIF [https://im2.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-2-46fb9dca3270.gif](https://im2.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-2-46fb9dca3270.gif) or the higher quality youtube clip comparing the Alpha/Beta Animation with the Retail Animation which can be seen here  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JFS-s4rUpE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JFS-s4rUpE)

Thanks to anyone trying to help.

Edit: Good comparison screenshot of what I mean from the video [https://imgur.com/a/sIMtFvf](https://imgur.com/a/sIMtFvf)

Edit2: Thanks to ""Monsuk"" for creating the Thread on the official US Forums here:  [https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/can-chaos-bolts-animation-be-fixed/317908](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/can-chaos-bolts-animation-be-fixed/317908)  if you can please upvote and comment his thread and keep it up top so Blizzard will be more likely to see it.

And also someone maybe post it in the BUG REPORT Forum since his is in the General Discussion Forum.

Edit3: Here is my post on the EU Bug Report Forums:  [https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/chaos-bolt-animation-bug-destruction-warlock/91523](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/chaos-bolt-animation-bug-destruction-warlock/91523) if you have time to spare please upvote and reply to it. I think we still need a post in the US Bug Report Forums.

Last night I had an experience that just cemented my positive opinions about PUGing.


I was finally dipping my toes in the water with a Pandarian Brewmaster and realized that I was NEVER going to learn to tank as a solo.  My tiny guild has been experiencing a lot of offline crap that keeps most of us out of game so my only option was to just dive into the random PUG roulette.


Within seconds my little Brewmaster was thrown into a team in a classic dungeon I honestly didn't know well so I made a PSA immediately that I was a new tank and didn't know the dungeon so folks could kick me if it was going to be a problem.  None of them were even a little phazed.


Instead of giving me crap, they stayed slow with me, providing pointers before unleashing me on our targets.  These random strangers were helpful, patient and friendly.  They gave me the confidence to think about what I was doing so I could get and almost always keep aggro and have fun doing the role I had taken on.


It was fun.  I learned a lot.  And then we all went our separate ways, precisely how I assume the LFG mechanic was meant to perform.  I only regret not having had time to friend at least some of them because they really were one of the finest teams I've had outside my guild of real life friends.

4030,Would a Recurring Leveling Micro-Holiday Interest You? (As an opportunity for fast leveling),"While Timewalking is great for leveling alts it has several pitfalls: the alt has to be in or above a specific level bracket to participate, it‚Äôs not terribly fast for dps players/specs, and involves running a limited number of old dungeons over and over. 

I have heard this other idea before and have discussed it with others and it seems like something like this would be good for people who like to level multiple alts and even for newer players to help them get to end game. 

It could look something like a weekend long event that boosts experience gains of all types by a set percentage that stacks with heirlooms and Warmode. Perhaps like 100-200%. The holiday could rotate through every couple/few weeks, perhaps slightly more often than Timewalking. It could also go on temporary hiatus when an expansion launches for obvious reasons (maybe for the first month or two). 

Having it be for all XP gains means that while certain methods will always be best depending on the bracket you‚Äôre in, you at least have some more options of things you can do that would award meaningful XP gains. Or you can scale it so that everything gets relatively close. Either way. 

I honestly don‚Äôt really see any downside to it. Even new players could benefit from a shot in the arm of their characters as they make their way through the game the first time; and it would be great for anyone looking to level a new alt. Especially with the way Allied races and heritage armor continues to be handled. 

You could even tie it in with a special bit of in-game replayable content, kinda like the Pre-Legion Demon Invasions. It could be as silly as Murloc invasions or something or you could make it more serious and it be like an invasion from the elemental plane/void/etc.",1569895637.0,"Would a Recurring Leveling Micro-Holiday Interest You?

4080,New battleground to think about,"I have always been thinking about how battle grounds relate to lore most of the times and thought that there are still a lot of lore-related events that happened either in books or warcraft trilogy.

So I came up with an idea of cap the point by. No, it is not tagging the flag and waiting some time for it to cap. Think of it more like wintergrasp or cap the cart but more massive.

I present to you *drumroll* Siege of Stormwind.
In Arthas Rise of the Lich King book we are vaguely told about orcs attacking stormwind and killing king Lleyn Wrinn, this the bg could already be something like a memory of past.

What this bg will be like? First of all, the attacking team (which is obviously horde) Has 10-15 minutes to capture the point and advance further. Once the point is captured, it becomes new spawn point. Once captured, you get added 10-15 minutes to the timer to capture the next point. If the time runs out, the defending side wins.

To better understand my idea. The first point is going to be the destruction of the gate. The horde will be able to craft sieges or maybe summon sieges by turning in something (like artifacts in ashran). Let's assume 15 minutes would be the time to cap a point. The horde has 15 minutes to destroy the gate, if they fail to do so, they lose, however, if the gate was destroyed with 3 minutes left on the clock, the amount of time you have for the next point would be 18 minutes (3 left, and +15 for new point). There would be at least 4 points within the city itself. One just right after the bridge, one at the auction house, then turn right to old town, and the last one would be right at the gates of the keep where sits the king.
So basically at this moment on you have the destruction of the gate, and 4 points in the city, making it 5 points already. Once the last point is capped, the goal is to kill the king. 

Sounds pretty straight forward, has interesting concept, but feels like blizzard would not dare to create another epic bg that would last for very long time if the attacker would advance slowly, capturing points at the last minute or so. 

What do you guys think of it? Should this at least count as a good idea for future concepts?",1569880080.0,"New battleground to think aboutI have always been thinking about how battle grounds relate to lore most of the times and thought that there are still a lot of lore-related events that happened either in books or warcraft trilogy.

4083,"Hey Blizz, are these Bee-events meant to require mythic tier dps and coordination?","For those of you unfamiliar, as part of the Alliance Bee Mount content there are some small events that happen every twenty minutes throughout the zone.  The event consists of waves of enemies that grow progressively stronger with a chance to spawn a rare every 5 levels, increasing the longer you go, such that it's almost guaranteed by level 15.  No matter what, you get some jellies, but the focus is much more on spawning and successfully defeating the rare.  To thwart you, the waves have a scaling buff that increases their health and damage.

The problem is that in addition to the scaling buff specific to the event, the mobs also have the base ""tag"" scaling, such that their health goes up for each person on their threat table.  The result being mobs with huge health pools in a timed event.

Now on the whole, there's nothing particularly wrong with that.  Since the rares have a chance to spawn at wave 5 and wave 10, getting to wave 15 isn't absolutely necessary.  The problem is in the emergent gameplay that has risen around these events and its insane level of toxicity.

Since the event is free tag, anyone can come and hit a bear once and increase that mob's health.  Then that person is free to lazily dps, often not compensating for the health increase that they've caused.  To combat this, groups have organized into raids that have a plan and use bloodlust and try to get to round 15.  They do this while spamming for anyone with ""low dps"" to not attack the mobs, not use AoE, not do anything really.  Despite this, the raid group will usually be unable to overcome the damage deficit and will turn their wrath on the surrounding people who are, supposedly, doing a very low investment mount farm.   The vitriolic language that I saw in these groups over the weekend was a stark contrast to the generally cheerful and helpful attitude around the mount farm earlier in the week.

Now, to me, it seems that the tag health scaling shouldn't be there, or at least be significantly reduced or capped at a certain number.  If you remove that, it becomes a fun race to see how far you can get.  The rares aren't farmable as they're a once a day kill like all the others.  The event itself has a cooldown on when you can receive rewards.  Nor is the event rare, spawning every 20 minutes. 

This should be addressed in some fashion because its one sore spot in an otherwise delightful content drop.  Even if it's only an explanation of Blizzard's intent with these events.",1569879687.0,"Hey Blizz, are these Bee-events meant to require mythic tier dps and coordination?For those of you unfamiliar, as part of the Alliance Bee Mount content there are some small events that happen every twenty minutes throughout the zone.

4088,Returning Player Looking For Help!,"As the title suggests, I'm a returning player (left at the start of Cataclysm) that is looking for advice, particularly in regards to levelling new characters. I've decided that it's best to start from scratch so I can learn all of the new mechanics as I progress, but I'm having a problem with the questing.

I'm mainly a horde player, and I'm finding that levelling areas are extremely non-linear, and that I'm levelling too fast to reasonably finish an area before moving on to the next. This has left me feeling like I'm missing out on content like low-lvl dungeons and major expansions, because the pace of the game is much faster than I remember.

Basically, can anyone give me advice on whether I should move on to new areas as soon as the opportunity presents it's self, and if so, are there any areas you find more fun than others, since I'm likely to skip a heap of potential zones.

Also, now that I have a lvl 80 warrior, what approach should I take to expansion content? I skipped Burning Crusade almost entirely because I was already able to move on to WotLK by the time I half-finished the Hellfire Peninsula, so is there any content I should focus on completing?

Lastly, are there any world-quests or events that are mandatory to complete to access end-game content? I feel like a complete beginner now, and I'm struggling to find information for stuff like this, so thanks to anyone that can help.

4094,[Retail] Looking for ADDON that creates a small scale duplicate of my action bar in the center of my screen.,"[TL:DR Picture Summary](https://i.redd.it/05brealqeqp31.png)

EDIT: I've tried Bartender again and I think I will learn to live with the setup I have with that. Thanks for the feedback everyone.

I'm a new player and I've been having trouble keeping my focus on my character during dungeons (and combat in general). This is because I keep looking at my ActionBar for when my ability cooldowns end.

In order to keep my eyes more on my character I went looking for an addon that creates a SMALL scale DUPLICATE of my ActionBar in the center of my screen. I specifically want a duplicate of my existing bar for the following reasons:

* I wouldn't have to drag new abilities to this middle-of-the-screen actionbar as they become available to me with levelling.
* I wouldn't have to set up this middle-of-the-screen actionbar by dragging abilities to it on every new class / spec I play. It would simply take the abilities in the existing actionbar and create a copy of it closer to my character.

Currently I'm using the TellMeWhen addon which gets me pretty close to what I want but it has a couple of obstacles:

* I can't click on the buttons from the addon (since they're technically not an actionbar, but a cooldown notifier)
* It doesn't show hotkeys on the buttons
* It takes quite a long time to set up, longer than adding a new actionbar and dragging abilities to it.

I'd also like to add that I'm not looking for profound UI overhaul, I'd like to stick to the vanilla UI as much as possible and simply add this actionbar duplicate in the middle of my screen. I'd love to hear if any more experienced players known an addon that would satisfy my need.

I am trying to make a cast sequence macro so when I press my macro key it will use *""Dragon Roar""* and then *""Whirlwind""* before resetting back to being *""Dragon Roar""* again after the 35 second cooldown.

The problem that I have with this is the *""reset=35""* only starts after the last time I press the key when I would prefer for it to start the reset countdown after the first ability press *(right after the first cast of Dragon Roar)*.

 Since then I've setup my UI as it used to be and got to do some dungeons with my lvl 100+ Warrior (currently dungeoning as tank).

But wow I'm blown away by everything. Especially the quality of every single animation and skill effect. The warrior charge and Leap are amaziing, as well as the attacks.

I've tested some other classes and I'm simply blown away by how good the spells are, how much impact they have and in general the quality is crazy good.

4285,My hopes for next expansion as a casual player (mostly gameplay-wise):,"Perhaps Cata 2.0? Not literally, but we could have some features that were in Cata, such as:

- Old World revamp: the world's outdated by now, it would be nice for the world to be updated to current events, with new quests and things like that.

- New race/class combos: It's been some time since Cata, when races got new class combos. Worgen and goblins could get the Monk class, since Pandaren and monks canonically have been out for years lore-wise. Perhaps some Allied Races could get DKs (the Lich King could be raising new Death Knights, he did such in Legjon) with a revamped starting zone. Night Elf Paladins (warriors of Elune) would be cool as well.

Now for new features:

- Faction revamp and crossfaction cooperation: We literally ""broke the cycle"". This should be the last faction war and new factions could be introduced, maybe the ones that were sugested by a lot of people: Horde + Alliance, Sylvanas Loyalists and Night Elves who want revenge for Teldrassil. Horde and Alliance cooperation would help casual players like me a lot. Existing Horde and Alliance characters could get the choice to join Sylvanas or Tyrande instead of Horde + Alliance.

- More RPG and customization elements: I personally think it would be amazing if old races had tattoos and new hairstyles like Allied Races. Not only that, but it would be very cool for classes to get brand-new glyphs that improve customization for spells -- maybe *racial* glyphs could be introduced, glyphs for races instead of classes, like a glyph that lets melee worgen fight with their claws, dwarves have stone or lightning effects on attacks, night elf priests have moon effects on spells, Dark Iron dwarves have fire effects, Loa glyphs for trolls, and a lot of other things.

- Tinker class? Literally tons of people suggested this one, and it's pretty predictable, but I would be lying if I said I don't want them. Using a mech or mechanical suit for battle would be fun.

- MAYBE new specs for all classes: Now this would be pretty fun to try out, but I'm not sure if Blizzard can balance one new spec for all classes and the existing specs at the same time. It still would be exciting to try out things like Druids of the Talon, Light Demon Hunters, Shadow Paladins, Stone Shaman tanks, Gladiator Warriors, Astral Projection Monks, etc.

4345,Warcraft IV & Shadowlands,"This is all wild speculation on my part that started as I was washing my dishes.

So, with Tyrande leaving Anduin on read amidst what appears to be yet another forgiveness of the Horde, it seems like the kaldorei might split off from the Alliance. It would make sense in lore, although I doubt Blizzard has the balls to do that in the actual game.

Likewise, [we know that there are still loyalists to Sylvanas](https://i.redd.it/ulwj8u7282p31.png), despite her Team Rocketing off at Orgrimmar.

Someone else said it first, but it looks like there are four factions going forward: Alliance, Horde, Night Elves and Undead. Ring a bell?

The Shadowlands ""leaks"" suggest that Sylvanas will kill all of us to send our asses to the Shadowlands and fight *something.* I don't particularly believe much in the leak, but for the sake of argument, let's say that it's true. 

Blizzard can't run Warcraft IV's story and WoW's concurrently; it would be a total mess for gameplay. We barely get even the illusion of choice in the current story, so splitting Horde and Alliance into two more factions just seems unlikely--in WoW. Thus, if we were *preoccupied* on another plane of existence, Warcraft IV could occur while we're gone. 

Assuming all this comes to pass, do you think that the PCs' ""deaths"" and conflict in Shadowlands would just be the perfect excuse for Blizzard to launch Warcraft IV? While we're dicking around in the afterlife, unable to meddle in Azeroth's affairs, the four factions have returned to their roots in Warcraft III.

Note, I don't particularly believe this theory. Do I think it would be cool? Hell yeah. Do I think Blizzard will actually do it or pull it off? God no.",1569780547.0,"Warcraft IV & ShadowlandsThis is all wild speculation on my part that started as I was washing my dishes.

So, with Tyrande leaving Anduin on read amidst what appears to be yet another forgiveness of the Horde, it seems like the kaldorei might split off from the Alliance. It would make sense in lore, although I doubt Blizzard has the balls to do that in the actual game.

Likewise, [we know that there are still loyalists to Sylvanas](https://i.redd.it/ulwj8u7282p31.png), despite her Team Rocketing off at Orgrimmar.

Someone else said it first, but it looks like there are four factions going forward: Alliance, Horde, Night Elves and Undead. Ring a bell?

The Shadowlands ""leaks"" suggest that Sylvanas will kill all of us to send our asses to the Shadowlands and fight *something.* I don't particularly believe much in the leak, but for the sake of argument, let's say that it's true. 

Blizzard can't run Warcraft IV's story and WoW's concurrently; it would be a total mess for gameplay. We barely get even the illusion of choice in the current story, so splitting Horde and Alliance into two more factions just seems unlikely--in WoW. Thus, if we were *preoccupied* on another plane of existence, Warcraft IV could occur while we're gone. 

Assuming all this comes to pass, do you think that the PCs' ""deaths"" and conflict in Shadowlands would just be the perfect excuse for Blizzard to launch Warcraft IV? While we're dicking around in the afterlife, unable to meddle in Azeroth's affairs, the four factions have returned to their roots in Warcraft III.

4348,Theory: Sylvanas' actions in BfA are compelled by the events at Teldrassil,"So I'm struggling with Sylvanas going from having a horror of death to wanting to bring it to everyone, everywhere, I admit. And it occurred to me that I've seen something very like this before.

People familiar with Death Note will remember how Light Yagami initially murders someone completely by accident: he plays with a notebook that says anyone whose name you write in it dies. He doesn't take it seriously, someone does indeed die, and events spiral as he rationalises his actions and  turns his first two murders into acts that he can live with - they were bad people who should have been killed, and so he's going to kill everyone who was like them.

Bringing this back to Sylvanas, we all remember how the burning of Teldrassil *isn't planned*. It appears to happen in a fit of rage - even Nathanos is astonished. It's incredibly difficult to imagine that Sylvanas went to Teldrassil *intending* to commit genocide.

I think it's convincing, if unlikely to be what Blizzard have in mind, that something in Sylvanas - the last of the Ranger-General, maybe - snapped in that moment. And the increasing evil she's fallen into, different in nature from the ordinary evil of the Forsaken, is at least in part driven by a need to reconcile what she has done with her self-image.",1569780150.0,"Theory: Sylvanas' actions in BfA are compelled by the events at TeldrassilSo I'm struggling with Sylvanas going from having a horror of death to wanting to bring it to everyone, everywhere, I admit.

4381,WoW Races and Allied Races ideas and projects,"Hi, I may have a big autism case but I can't stop thinking about the faction merge or dissolution we may have next patch. That has been my dream since I started playing back in Cataclysm and finally I will be able to have one of every race/class/spec without having to abandon my friends. But, that got me into thinking about our current Alliance - Horde structure.

Then, I started thinking about the missed out opportunities we had in this and last expansions and what Allied Races (or actual Races) we should've gotten but didn't. Then I decide to map then out, try to pair them up and as soon as I'm satisfied with that, begin imagining racials and class availability.

This is what I've managed to come up with today, and after there's some reasoning behind them:

https://i.redd.it/iyv1jax1sgp31.png

The first 8 suggestions are allied races I think we should have gotten BEFORE BFA even started:

* **Garadar Mag'har (Horde):** With Saurfang's death and Thrall's return to (maybe) lead the Horde, after an absence he had to take after losing faith in himself, during which he moved back to his wife's homeland, the world we know as Outland, the homeland of the Mag'har Orcs. Not the ones we already have, but  the original Mag'har orcs from The Burning Crusade. The ones we met and learned they had been resisting the influence of the demons and their green-skinned brethren. The ones we helped against both the Alliance and Illidari forces. The ones that joined Thrall's horde in the Warsong Offensive. The ones that became part of the True Horde, influenced by the sad development of one of their own. The ones that, after seeing how bad Garrosh had become, joined ranks with the other races of the Horde and Alliance to take him off his power. The ones that then fought against Garrosh's Iron Horde to redeem themselves, even though some of their own had switched sides. We then would have the Garadar Mag'har descendants, led by Thrall and Aggra themselves, in the Horde *(I feel we should have actually had those refugee Mag'har instead of the alternate ones, and the alternate ones should be only introduced in the patch/expansion they want to actually deal with the evil side of the Light)*;
* **Outland Broken** **(Alliance):** Since we would be getting a race from Outland, it would be only natural to also add the other major race we met during The Burning Crusade. The Broken tribes we met there are the Ashtongue, led by Akama - who would be free from his constant struggle of keeping appearances of his servitude to Illidan, since now he is definitely good guy - and the Kurenai, independent Broken who are in war with both the Ogres and the Garadar Mag'har;
* **Ogres (Horde):** To finish off the list of races we should have gotten in The Burning Crusade, Rexxar would finally manage to centralize the different Ogre tribes - Stonemaul, Ango'rosh, Warmaul, Boulderfist, etc- into one huge clan and maybe even being joined by the Mok'nathal and Leoroxx himself. Ever since the beginning of the Horde we have had contact with Ogres and we should've been able to play them since the beginning;
* **Quel'dorei/High Elves (Alliance):** Another race every WoW player has always wanted to play and never got to, even getting to the point of being teased because we wanted to. Vereesa Windrunner would lead her High Elves into joining her sister Alleria's Void Elves.. Obviously they would be very similar to the Blood Elves, but with the huge difference they would be part of the Alliance;
* **Wildhammer Dwarves (Alliance):** The Council of Three Hammers are comprised of three dwarven subraces: Ironforge dwarves, Dark Iron dwarves and Wildhammer dwarves. Since vanilla we've had the former, we actually managed to get the Dark Iron even though their allegiance is severely doubted (even getting to the point of having an active Cult of Ragnaros in their midst) and their history of killing Alliance members. Then, why haven't we gotten the MUCH MORE INTRINSIC part of the Alliance, the Wildhammer?;
* **Revantusk Trolls (Horde):** Another example of a race we could've gotten into the game without having to deeply changing the status quo our players have with are the Revantusk Trolls. Instead of starting with the huge storyline to make the Zandalari join the Horde, why didn't we expand upon the Revantusk tribe and their war against the Wildhammer dwarves (and also finally getting the beefy troll model) as playable;
* **Frostborn Dwarves (Alliance):** Since we are expanding our variety of available dwarves, we could also have Velog Icebellow join his king Yorg Stormheart - who he now knows is the leader of the Bronzebeard dwarves, Muradin. With this, maybe we could've had a Council of Four Hammers? Maybe even Five if we consider Thargas Anvilmar is also a Senator;
* **Farraki Trolls (Horde):** To finish off with the variety expansion, we would also need to have access to the last variety of trolls still numerous enough to actually be playable and who are also not an enemy faction (like the Amani and Gurubashi in Zul'Aman and Zul'Gurub, respectively) - the Farraki tribe (and get the last troll model, the squishy one);

Then, I thought about races/Allied Races we could get from now on, based on what happened in BFA:

* **Light Undead (Alliance):** With the resurgence of Calia Menethil and her importance in the novel and more recently in the latest patch (also because of the relevancy in Lilian Voss' quest where you eavesdrop Calia and Derek Proudmoore's conversation) - I find it quite obvious we'll be getting a Light-themed version of our Undead, now they've been forsaken *again;*
* **Fogsail Freebooters (Horde):** To balance Alliance having access to (newer) undead models, it's fair for Horde to get access to the human ones. With their agreement in Tiragarde and since the Alliance is not in open war against the Horde, it's pretty reasonable the human pirates could officially join the Horde (with the skinny kul tiran model);
* **Junker Gnomes (Alliance):** I REALLY hope we will have Junker gnomes in the near future, since we had a big fuss about Mechagon - a long-lost island which was never found before but was so close from Kul Tiras they actually share the same map page - and since then it has been abandoned. Even though the Junker Gnomes are neutral with both Gnomes and Goblins, I find it more likely they'll join the Alliance;
* **Voldunai (Horde):** Mostly the same reasoning of the Junker Gnomes. We had some quests where we saved the Voldunai from Alliance and they had actually joined the Horde. That and the fact we recently had the goblin model rigs updated (out of nowhere, since they have no importance in the current storyline) - and the Voldunai use that as well - only makes me think we'll have the controversial Voldunai as playable races;
* **Unshackled Gilblin (Horde):** We have freed them from Azshara and soon we'll be freeing them from N'Zoth as well. They also share the updated goblin model rigs and have had importance and will soon be abandoned. Since Gallywix is seeming to lose his relevancy in goblin society (Gazlowe was in Saurfang's funeral and Gallywix disappeared with Sylvanas to shoot the big cannon in Azshara to kill Azshara), I hope Neri Sharpfin rises up to teach the goblins there are other things more important in life;
* **Waveblade Ankoan (Alliance):** These fishmen are actually the coolest looking species in Nazjatar right now. They came out of nowhere to surpass the Naga as the baddassest race in the ocean. Since the Gilblin will be joining the Horde, why not accept the Ankoan into the Alliance?;
* **Pearlfin Jinyu (Alliance):** And then we could go back to Pandaria to correct what should've happened and also add the long-lost relatives of the Ankoan into the Alliance as well, since they ARE already officially Alliance members. Maybe we could get a Fishman race with customization options to differ them from Ankoan and Jinyu, but they definitely should be playable;
* **Grookin Hill Hozen (Horde):** While we are back at Pandaria, we would also add Chief Kah Kah's Hozen into the horde, where we'll finally be able to use banana-inspired traps (like the ones all over Siege of Boralus);
* **Stillpine Furbolg (Alliance):** With an monkey-inspired race joining the Horde, it's only fair to also add to the anthropomorphic animal races with the O.G. partners of the Night Elf druids: the Furbolg will be joining (as long as with an updated model similar to the Guardian Druid mage tower artifact appearance? Please, Blizzard) the Alliance and reinforcing Tyrande's army against the Banshee Queen;
* **Northrend Taunka (Horde):** Since the Banshee Queen will obviously be raiding Icecrown to finally become the Lich Queen, it's only natural her expedition to Northrend may cause a big conflict with the natives - especially the Taunka tribes. Back in WOTLK, they actually joined the Horde and then were never to be seen again (with the exception of some Flight Master) - but we could get the Taunka as playable races when the Sylvanas-hating Horde also goes once again to Northrend to try and stop Sylvanas from becoming the Lich Queen;

That's what I've thought of so far, but there are many other races I would love to have: Ethereal (who may be coming in a Void themed expansion), the Sethrak, Vrykul (maybe as the second neutral race who chooses his faction based on which one they find more worthy), the Sylvanas-allied San'layn and Undead Elves (both Blood and Night), maybe both the Centaur and Children of Cenarius, the Saurok and Saberon - who are both savage and not organized enough but would be amazing if playable - and from alternate Draenor the Botani and High Arakkoa.

Thanks for reading thus far and feel free to give me feedback on what I wrote. I will try and complete my list of suggestions, try and imagine class availability for them and when all is done, I may go for the faction split and how would be the relationship between races.",1569762189.0,"WoW Races and Allied Races ideas and projectsHi, I may have a big autism case but I can't stop thinking about the faction merge or dissolution we may have next patch. That has been my dream since I started playing back in Cataclysm and finally I will be able to have one of every race/class/spec without having to abandon my friends. But, that got me into thinking about our current Alliance - Horde structure.

Then, I started thinking about the missed out opportunities we had in this and last expansions and what Allied Races (or actual Races) we should've gotten but didn't. Then I decide to map then out, try to pair them up and as soon as I'm satisfied with that, begin imagining racials and class availability.

This is what I've managed to come up with today, and after there's some reasoning behind them:

https://i.redd.it/iyv1jax1sgp31.png

The first 8 suggestions are allied races I think we should have gotten BEFORE BFA even started:

* **Garadar Mag'har (Horde):** With Saurfang's death and Thrall's return to (maybe) lead the Horde, after an absence he had to take after losing faith in himself, during which he moved back to his wife's homeland, the world we know as Outland, the homeland of the Mag'har Orcs. Not the ones we already have, but  the original Mag'har orcs from The Burning Crusade. The ones we met and learned they had been resisting the influence of the demons and their green-skinned brethren. The ones we helped against both the Alliance and Illidari forces. The ones that joined Thrall's horde in the Warsong Offensive. The ones that became part of the True Horde, influenced by the sad development of one of their own. The ones that, after seeing how bad Garrosh had become, joined ranks with the other races of the Horde and Alliance to take him off his power. The ones that then fought against Garrosh's Iron Horde to redeem themselves, even though some of their own had switched sides. We then would have the Garadar Mag'har descendants, led by Thrall and Aggra themselves, in the Horde *(I feel we should have actually had those refugee Mag'har instead of the alternate ones, and the alternate ones should be only introduced in the patch/expansion they want to actually deal with the evil side of the Light)*;
* **Outland Broken** **(Alliance):** Since we would be getting a race from Outland, it would be only natural to also add the other major race we met during The Burning Crusade. The Broken tribes we met there are the Ashtongue, led by Akama - who would be free from his constant struggle of keeping appearances of his servitude to Illidan, since now he is definitely good guy - and the Kurenai, independent Broken who are in war with both the Ogres and the Garadar Mag'har;
* **Ogres (Horde):** To finish off the list of races we should have gotten in The Burning Crusade, Rexxar would finally manage to centralize the different Ogre tribes - Stonemaul, Ango'rosh, Warmaul, Boulderfist, etc- into one huge clan and maybe even being joined by the Mok'nathal and Leoroxx himself. Ever since the beginning of the Horde we have had contact with Ogres and we should've been able to play them since the beginning;
* **Quel'dorei/High Elves (Alliance):** Another race every WoW player has always wanted to play and never got to, even getting to the point of being teased because we wanted to. Vereesa Windrunner would lead her High Elves into joining her sister Alleria's Void Elves.. Obviously they would be very similar to the Blood Elves, but with the huge difference they would be part of the Alliance;
* **Wildhammer Dwarves (Alliance):** The Council of Three Hammers are comprised of three dwarven subraces: Ironforge dwarves, Dark Iron dwarves and Wildhammer dwarves. Since vanilla we've had the former, we actually managed to get the Dark Iron even though their allegiance is severely doubted (even getting to the point of having an active Cult of Ragnaros in their midst) and their history of killing Alliance members. Then, why haven't we gotten the MUCH MORE INTRINSIC part of the Alliance, the Wildhammer?;
* **Revantusk Trolls (Horde):** Another example of a race we could've gotten into the game without having to deeply changing the status quo our players have with are the Revantusk Trolls. Instead of starting with the huge storyline to make the Zandalari join the Horde, why didn't we expand upon the Revantusk tribe and their war against the Wildhammer dwarves (and also finally getting the beefy troll model) as playable;
* **Frostborn Dwarves (Alliance):** Since we are expanding our variety of available dwarves, we could also have Velog Icebellow join his king Yorg Stormheart - who he now knows is the leader of the Bronzebeard dwarves, Muradin. With this, maybe we could've had a Council of Four Hammers? Maybe even Five if we consider Thargas Anvilmar is also a Senator;
* **Farraki Trolls (Horde):** To finish off with the variety expansion, we would also need to have access to the last variety of trolls still numerous enough to actually be playable and who are also not an enemy faction (like the Amani and Gurubashi in Zul'Aman and Zul'Gurub, respectively) - the Farraki tribe (and get the last troll model, the squishy one);

Then, I thought about races/Allied Races we could get from now on, based on what happened in BFA:

* **Light Undead (Alliance):** With the resurgence of Calia Menethil and her importance in the novel and more recently in the latest patch (also because of the relevancy in Lilian Voss' quest where you eavesdrop Calia and Derek Proudmoore's conversation) - I find it quite obvious we'll be getting a Light-themed version of our Undead, now they've been forsaken *again;*
* **Fogsail Freebooters (Horde):** To balance Alliance having access to (newer) undead models, it's fair for Horde to get access to the human ones. With their agreement in Tiragarde and since the Alliance is not in open war against the Horde, it's pretty reasonable the human pirates could officially join the Horde (with the skinny kul tiran model);
* **Junker Gnomes (Alliance):** I REALLY hope we will have Junker gnomes in the near future, since we had a big fuss about Mechagon - a long-lost island which was never found before but was so close from Kul Tiras they actually share the same map page - and since then it has been abandoned. Even though the Junker Gnomes are neutral with both Gnomes and Goblins, I find it more likely they'll join the Alliance;
* **Voldunai (Horde):** Mostly the same reasoning of the Junker Gnomes. We had some quests where we saved the Voldunai from Alliance and they had actually joined the Horde. That and the fact we recently had the goblin model rigs updated (out of nowhere, since they have no importance in the current storyline) - and the Voldunai use that as well - only makes me think we'll have the controversial Voldunai as playable races;
* **Unshackled Gilblin (Horde):** We have freed them from Azshara and soon we'll be freeing them from N'Zoth as well. They also share the updated goblin model rigs and have had importance and will soon be abandoned. Since Gallywix is seeming to lose his relevancy in goblin society (Gazlowe was in Saurfang's funeral and Gallywix disappeared with Sylvanas to shoot the big cannon in Azshara to kill Azshara), I hope Neri Sharpfin rises up to teach the goblins there are other things more important in life;
* **Waveblade Ankoan (Alliance):** These fishmen are actually the coolest looking species in Nazjatar right now. They came out of nowhere to surpass the Naga as the baddassest race in the ocean. Since the Gilblin will be joining the Horde, why not accept the Ankoan into the Alliance?;
* **Pearlfin Jinyu (Alliance):** And then we could go back to Pandaria to correct what should've happened and also add the long-lost relatives of the Ankoan into the Alliance as well, since they ARE already officially Alliance members. Maybe we could get a Fishman race with customization options to differ them from Ankoan and Jinyu, but they definitely should be playable;
* **Grookin Hill Hozen (Horde):** While we are back at Pandaria, we would also add Chief Kah Kah's Hozen into the horde, where we'll finally be able to use banana-inspired traps (like the ones all over Siege of Boralus);
* **Stillpine Furbolg (Alliance):** With an monkey-inspired race joining the Horde, it's only fair to also add to the anthropomorphic animal races with the O.G. partners of the Night Elf druids: the Furbolg will be joining (as long as with an updated model similar to the Guardian Druid mage tower artifact appearance?

* **Northrend Taunka (Horde):** Since the Banshee Queen will obviously be raiding Icecrown to finally become the Lich Queen, it's only natural her expedition to Northrend may cause a big conflict with the natives - especially the Taunka tribes.

The old guard of the Horde is in mourning. Fearful of Malfurion's return, the titans of the Horde have taken to wearing black armor and carrying heavy black bags. As such, their faction is unrecognizable from the one that once comprised Stormwind.

For the titans, this is a fitting end. Malfurion had hoped that by uniting the Horde and Alliance, he could finally unite Azeroth once more. Unfortunately, his plans have gone awry. Angry at being left behind, the titans have taken to raiding Stormwind's Trade Spots to fill their bellies.

The titans have managed to secure a shipment of Beasts that could only be obtained through the course of bloody battles. Should this prove successful, the heroes of Azeroth may finally be able to challenge the titan rulers once more.

The brand-new adventure begins in the beautiful city of Arak at the center of the Elemental Plane. But something is amiss in the Elemental Plane...

Arak is rumored to be home to a dark shrine to the Old Gods -- a place of great power but which neither faction can access. Is this what the Warchief means when he calls upon the strength of the Air Elemental to aid him in the coming battle?

4428,"[xpost] Dunno if this belongs here, but 3.x TBC may be a contender for the best wow version to go back to!","Long stories short, I am a Chinese wow player who played from retail vanilla to retail cataclysm in China. In China from 2008 to 2010, due to feud between the two Chinese distributors of WoW (formerly [the9.com](https://the9.com), now Netease) and censorship about undead and such, WotLK in China was delayed to, like, a few months before retail Cataclysm in the rest of the world.

So for a long time, we were playing 3.x version of the game (iirc, 3.1.3), but only with TBC contents.

However, ironically, this period of time is when WoW population peaked in China. I think this version of the game actually has a lot of merits. Sure this version has quite a few weaknesses too, but I generally talk about merits here.

Some people say TBC is the best WoW, some say WotLK. Maybe this ... gets the best of both worlds?

Merits retained from 2.4 TBC or WotLK:

* Awesome looking sets. T5-T6 have some of the most memorable set looks, T6 is recycled later in Legion I believe. Absolution set was beautiful.
* Players still have reasons to go to a variety of raids even if they are capable of doing the raid that drops the best loot. SW-capable players may still do Gruul or ZAM for trinkets.
* Sunwell patch has a lot of progression possibilitiess for a lot of classes. Many class can have a goal of 4+4 set bonus in PvP (PvP set + T6 pieces from SW), and theorycraft which trinket comes from PvE and which item comes from PvP.
* Achievement system is a nice addition for people want to chase ... titles or things.

What is better than 2.4 TBC:

* Class balance is better. Sure some specs get shorter end of stick especially if key abilities are learned after lvl70 (Ele shaman's lava burst), but generally, every hybrid class would have competitive, not just viable, non-healer specs, in either PvE or PvP.
* Faction balance is better. Most TBC private servers lean heavily towards Horde because they are better in almost every possible way. 3.x gave Humans the every man for himself ability, and gave ally Paladins seal of Martyr, and equalized priest racial spells so alliance Paladins and priests can compete with Horde counter parts, etc.
   * And with generally easy PvE, it is easy to get better faction balance.
* World PvP. People say fly mounts killed world PvP, but in 3.x TBC, with almost all competent guilds or even PuGs are able to do Sunwell, the Isle of Quel'danas (where flight is not available) is absolutely a warzone on balanced servers. Many Chinese players think the Isle to be the best world PvP place of all time.
* Faction leaders are actually hard to take down. Because they are scaled to level 80 already.
* Removal of Attunements (at least some of them result in a better outcome) - this one is controversial and subjective, but some attunements in TBC are kinda unfair: you need to kill both Vashj and Kael'thas, two of the most mechanically difficult fights in TBC, to go to Hyjal, which has a few arguably much easier bosses that drop better loot. The gap between guilds that could do Vashj/Kael and those that couldn't were huge.

What is better than WotLK:

* No DKs, arguably an OP class for most of WotLK. The rest of class balance is great in Wrath, but DKs are not.
* No some of the bad designs added to the game: LFG, four difficuties per raid are the big two.
* Again, better world PvP. WotLK doesn't have a zone like Isle of Quel'danas where flying is disabled (Wintergrasp during siege doesn't count).

Of course, there are downsides too. 3.x TBC is a stagnant version that doesn't get new contents. It starts with Sunwell content, and ends with Sunwell content.

Also, due to how easy it is, it won't attract any guilds that is remotely hardcore ...

This, however, can be compared to Classic in some ways. Classic from MC to BWL is relatively easy, and the differences between casual and hardcore player is not that overwhelming. This allows casual players to survive or even thrive. Most private servers began losing population in AQ or NAXX stages of the game, as the power creep becomes overwhelming for the casuals. However, AQ (especially the scarab lord grind) and NAXX at least gives hardcore guilds something to look forward to, while 3.x TBC doesn't have any of that.

But, hardcore guilds have retail (or if they are not so hardcore, maybe even FFXIV can work for them, but I digress) anyways!

P.S. I wonder which sub this thread would fit the best? It is quite tough to find a best fit because this thread isn't really about classic(for /r/classicwow), or current retail (for /r/wow), and isn't about an ongoing private server (for /r/wowservers).",1569745826.0,"[xpost] Dunno if this belongs here, but 3.x TBC may be a contender for the best wow version to go back to!Long stories short, I am a Chinese wow player who played from retail vanilla to retail cataclysm in China.

4429,MY idea for why WoW is boring if you do not raid.,"I've had this thought for a long time that when I'm not raiding with a group, almost all of the content feels pointless to do. So when my friends end up quitting, even though I love the game itself, I just feel there is no reason to keep playing because why grind this gear to eventually get strong for a raid I will never do.

I believe that WoW needs something that is almost non-combat oriented that will stick with you from expansion to expansion. My idea has always been player houses like other games have that you can decorate with stuff you find while playing the game, a bosses head, a rare drop that goes in your house, something of the sort. That is just my idea, there are others, it doesn't have to be a house. 

I've noticed ""newer"" mmos like guild wars 2, rift, final fantasy, while I don't enjoy the combat or end game even a fraction as much as I do for WoW, they have other things that I really enjoy, like final fantasy has their professions, fishing is actually enjoyable and not just clicking a bobber, guild wars 2 has jump puzzles, rift has (had?) their house system I loved, even though it was pay to win which sucked. There just needs to be SOMETHING that I can do that isn't going to be completely irrelevant the second an expansion, or even a patch drops.  Thanks a ton if you read this far, please post thoughts or ideas you have as well.",1569745482.0,"MY idea for why WoW is boring if you do not raid.I've had this thought for a long time that when I'm not raiding with a group, almost all of the content feels pointless to do.

4430,Old player's noob questions,"I quit wow in 2010 and as many others, came back to classic and played to 60 now. However what I really wished the game had back then was automated dungeon finder, and I believe that's been the case for a while now in retail.

How many ""accessible"" 5mans or raids there are in BfA, that you can do with the LFP/R? Is it common to have your end-game be just grinding max difficulty 5mans, and is it easy to get parties for them? Because all I'd like to do is try to do 5mans fast, but I have no idea if the mythic difficulties are something you can't consider with automated dungeon searcher.

Basically what I'm asking is, can I run the hardest difficulty 5mans in BfA without friends/guilds, assuming my own capabilities are enough, after I've geared up from lower difficulties? Can the matchmaker figure out who's good enough for it to get reasonable group together or something? All I want is to log in, press a button to put myself into queue and get teleported to dungeon that has reasonable challenge, with people who are capable of beating it. Can that be done? I've got the feeling from classic fanatics that what I'm asking for is anti-wow and everything that's wrong with retail, so maybe it'd be better fit for me :)",1569745166.0,"Old player's noob questionsI quit wow in 2010 and as many others, came back to classic and played to 60 now.

4449,"I miss having ""my character""","I started playing MMORPGs with my brother many, many years ago, back in the Everquest days. I saw the box art for Everquest at a store and my brother surprised me with a copy of the most recent expansion a few days later. At first I would mostly just watch him play since I was pretty young. Then Everquest 2 came out and I made my first real character, a dark elf ranger (you had to faction switch to do that, was pretty awesome at the time). Then I saw it, and my life changed forever. An advertisement for World of Warcraft showcasing the rogue tier set. Even after all these years, I can still remember it vividly as it totally captured my imagination about what an MMORPG could entail. We made the switch to WoW together, playing on Alleria at the time. I made a Tauren hunter named Iobanio, he played an Orc warlock named Apacolypse. We had an incredible number of good times together. I looked forward to logging in to ""my"" hunter every night and exploring the world. 

Ever since then I have shared countless memories with dozens of friends, family and guild mates over 15 years. I haven't been subbed the whole time, I took breaks or had too many IRL commitments to make it worth it, but Orgrimmar was always my home. I will never forget when my brother convinced me to come to Org from Mulgore, saying it was so amazing I had to come see. So I made the trek there and finally walked through the city gates. My mind was completely blown once again. 

Probably six months ago I stopped playing WoW. A lot of the friends I made along the way had quit years earlier and I had moved on from graduate school to a ""real"" job with a wife and child at home. It was much harder to do things with the guilds I tried out and nothing seemed to stick. Still there was my brother, who tried his best to continue playing with me, even though he also had a busy life. I ended up just losing a bit of hope in the game I had loved for so long, so I quit. I haven't logged into retail since then. 

Then classic came out. The golden goose that was going to solve all the problems with retail wow and bring back the community and reinforce player choice and reward skilled play. So my brother and I started playing again. However, while our characters had gone back in time 15 years, we had not. So our busy lives were still there. 

After I stopped playing retail wow I switched to some other games. I've played a lot of Warframe, Dota 2, Overwatch, and now Borderlands 3. While those games are all amazing in their own right, they lack that feeling. That feeling of logging in to ""my character"" that I had spent so many hours on. 

I really thought classic was going to solve everything. But no matter what class I tried the combat just felt so incredibly lackluster. I know many people enjoy the slower pace, and I am happy they are getting a game they cherish back, but for me vanilla was a lot of great memories that aren't that fun to play through again. 

So remember when I said I always thought of WoW as home, of Orgrimmar as home? That changed a little this week when I saw the cinematics for the war campaign. I know they didn't get a great reception, but overall I liked them, especially the thought of Azeroth being home instead of Orgrimmar. I want so badly to log in, but classic is too slow and I fear retail will feel like a lonely slog through levels of AP. 

I tagged this post as nostalgia, because that's what it is. And that's all I have left of WoW. Truly incredible nostalgia, but only that all the same. To those people who are still playing classic or retail and enjoying the game, I am happy for you. Part of me envies you at the same time. I had these thoughts as I was settling down to play some Borderlands while my wife and kids were at the store, and just wanted to share with someone. 

Someday, I hope to return to Azeroth, my home. For now though, it remains in memory.

I know they didn't get a great reception, but overall I liked them, especially the thought of Azeroth being home instead of Orgrimmar. I want so badly to log in, but classic is too slow and I fear retail will feel like a lonely slog through levels of AP. 

I tagged this post as nostalgia, because that's what it is. And that's all I have left of WoW. Truly incredible nostalgia, but only that all the same. To those people who are still playing classic or retail and enjoying the game, I am happy for you. Part of me envies you at the same time. I had these thoughts as I was settling down to play some Borderlands while my wife and kids were at the store, and just wanted to share with someone. 

Someday, I hope to return to Azeroth, my home. For now though, it remains in memory. Lok'tar ogar, my friends.",1

4533,"My thoughts on the fan reaction to ""Retribution""","I don't know about you, but I thought it was incredible! Sylvanas wants to stay ""alive"" above all else, and yes, I did think her actions were in line with her character.

Why would she care about the Horde? Sure, they took her in when no one else did, but by this point (or from even the beginning) she saw them as a means to an end, not a friend. Yes, her outburst was a blunder on her part, but a character without flaws is boring as fuck. She got caught up in her hubris, and when she was called out to be a failure in front of everyone, she got emotional and slipped. It's not that she cares about the loyalist soldiers' opinions, but it's that she believed they wouldn't be as useful to her if they saw her to be flawed. She wanted to be seen as a force of nature, and a force of nature doesn't have emotions. 

Furthermore, she destroyed Saurfang not only for vengence, but in an attempt to reestablish dominance over the situation. She cheated the Mak'Gora because she didn't care about honor, nor the Horde's opinion. It was now her decision to make them fear her as an all powerful enemy, not necessarily an honorable one. She was portrayed as weak by the rebels and by her own words. She wanted to replace that memory with a stronger one. A raid-level threat one. 

In my opinion, she definitely didn't want to leave the Horde that early, but she made the most of her fuck up. Addressing her desire to destroy the Alliance, she hates the alliance for abandoning her, not because of Horde/Alliance conflict. She is self-serving  and always was. The Forsaken were born not out of a desire to be accepted, but vengence. She wanted revenge, which is a selfish desire. Once Arthas was defeated, she literally tried to kill herself. However, as you all well know, that didn't succeed. Her fear of death permeates her every action, again acting out of selfish desire.

Finally, it must be mentioned that when Vol'jin made her warchief, she almost immediately began using Horde resources for her own gains. This was evident in Stormheim, where not only did Sylvanas attempt to force new Val'kir into her service, (thus giving her extra lives) but also making a still unknown pact with Helya. Also, on a final point about her appointment, Vol'jin could have very well been listening to the same entity Sylvanas mentioned in the loyalist cutscene (capitalized Death) that gave her the anomalous powers shown in the ""retribution"" cutscene. (blocking, magic blast, etc.) This could also perhaps be Bwomsamdi's boss, but that is too many layers of speculation to mean anything substantial. 

In conclusion, she is no saint, and she is not a hero. She is a self-serving manipulator who just so happened to have aligning goals with the rest of Azeroth for the first years of our time in Azeroth. She clearly doesn't need us anymore, and she wants us to know it. Although I will admit, I would've loved to kick her shit in.

4538,Gaping plot hole,"Sylvanas relying on N'Zoth to give her a bunch of corpses to raise is laughable when you consider that the Old Gods (N'Zoth in particular) have a tendency to corrupt their enemies instead of outright killing them. Just look at how he turned Azshara and her followers, who were about to die, into the naga, or how he had the Tidesages in Kul Tiras corrupted into k'thir and faceless. N'Zoth isn't the kind of Old God to just go around killing a bunch of people (and if they end up making him out to be, then that pretty much goes against everything they've been building him up as, even as the first Old God to be fully free); not when he can turn them over to his side instead. Hell, N'Zoth even corrupts ***player characters*** and turns them into sleeper agents within their respective factions (including those loyal to Sylvanas, meaning he knows all about her plan in the first place).

Then, you consider Sylvanas had a much better opportunity to do this during Legion, when the Burning Legion came to Azeroth with the goal of outright killing everything on the planet (the argument that the Legion would have just killed her and the forsaken as well applies just as much to the Old Gods; if not moreso because of how much the forces of void and death adamantly do not get along, meaning she'd be a priority to the latter). Not only that, but their end-goal was to kill the world-soul of Azeroth herself, which - if Sylvanas really does want to kill everything - would have only benefited her objective, whatever it might be (and we know planets can exist even without world-souls since there are plenty of them that never had world-souls to begin with and thrived with sentient life just fine). Of course, they didn't have the ""4D chessmaster who secretly has an agenda beyond your feeble mind's comprehension"" persona for her at the time of Legion, so of course she didn't follow through with any of this at the time; but her relying on the Old Gods to kill people over something like the Burning Legion is beyond stupid to me.

Tl;dr: Sylvanas's plan to use N'Zoth, someone who corrupts and manipulates his enemies, to get her an army of corpses would have had a much higher rate of success if she had tried it with the Burning Legion, who kill off entire planets' populations, instead; but she didn't do so with the latter because she was an entirely different character at that point",1569707927.0,"Gaping plot holeSylvanas relying on N'Zoth to give her a bunch of corpses to raise is laughable when you consider that the Old Gods (N'Zoth in particular) have a tendency to corrupt their enemies instead of outright killing them.

4560,Fel magic lore needs updating/fixing - it's inconsistent,"Fel  magic is currently described as a sacrificial magic, often interpreted  as the kind of magic that requires the destruction of life to be created and/or to be cast. One  example of this says that a warlock needs to sacrifice something  insignificant - a fish or a strand of weed to cast a spell. What it basically means is that anyone using fel turns into a  pseudo vampire - feeding on life of others. That would be a major drawback to using the fel magic.

Why would anyone prefer to put that much work into it and be basically dependent on other beings to make your spells work? I know fel is one of the most powerful magics, but considering all the drawbacks I can't see how it's worth it. Which is why I don't think this is the case at all.

Truly, we actually don't see that's the case with fel magic. I've never seen  anyone needing to perform a sacrifice in order to cast simple fel fire  spells for example. And I'm not just talking about the in-game  mechanics. This is evident in most trailers, cutscenes and even in a  Warcraft movie. Guldan, numerous demons, demon hunters - none of them  pause to sacrifice, nor does doing the spell casting evidently hurt  anyone - until after the spell is released of course.

The  only case this magic requires a sacrifice is when the spells get  complicated, such as: summoning demons, summoning portals, creating a  soulstone etc., which is acceptable. Anything else seems like a badly written attempt to further  villianize the warlocks, demons and anything fel related.",1569700689.0,"Fel magic lore needs updating/fixing - it's inconsistentFel  magic is currently described as a sacrificial magic, often interpreted  as the kind of magic that requires the destruction of life to be created and/or to be cast.

What it basically means is that anyone using fel turns into a  pseudo vampire - feeding on life of others. That would be a major drawback to using the fel magic.

Why would anyone prefer to put that much work into it and be basically dependent on other beings to make your spells work? I know fel is one of the most powerful magics, but considering all the drawbacks I can't see how it's worth it. Which is why I don't think this is the case at all.

Truly, we actually don't see that's the case with fel magic. I've never seen  anyone needing to perform a sacrifice in order to cast simple fel fire  spells for example. And I'm not just talking about the in-game  mechanics. This is evident in most trailers, cutscenes and even in a  Warcraft movie. Guldan, numerous demons, demon hunters - none of them  pause to sacrifice, nor does doing the spell casting evidently hurt  anyone - until after the spell is released of course.

The  only case this magic requires a sacrifice is when the spells get  complicated, such as: summoning demons, summoning portals, creating a  soulstone etc., which is acceptable. Anything else seems like a badly written attempt to further  villianize the warlocks, demons and anything fel related.",1

4568,Nazjatar is just the worst parts of Vash'jir and Argus with none of the upsides.,"Vash'jir, however controversial it was, was loved by a minority of players for the underwater dynamic to navigate the significant amounts of verticality in the zone. Nazjatar brings back that verticality, except locks you to land until you've grinded for weeks to fly. What's the point? Why is it not just an underwater zone at this point? And at least Vash'jir had a pretty solid storyline too while Nazjatar is more of an exploration zone like Broken Shore is.

Nazjatar has the same controversial mob density that Argus had. The defense of that from players who enjoyed that element was that Argus was the conclusion of Warcraft 3's story that had been going on for around twenty years, and being the home planet of the primary antagonists, there's an expectation of difficulty and mob density.

Nazjatar is just a bunch of murlocs and crabs, and sometimes Naga. While Azshara is of course not as powerful as the Legion, Nazjatar doesn't aesthetically feel like it's the capital city of the Naga. They're not exactly powerful villains at this point anymore either, and what makes it worse is that at least one NPC comments on how Nazjatar used to be so much more dangerous and harsh before the tides parted.

4577,[Guardian] Second Ironfur or Waking Dream?,"I have been playing moonkin so far this expansion, but would like to get a bit into M+ tanking for an occasional pace of change. The last time I tanked was in WoD, so there is quite a bit to learn. Tanking would be only for low keys in PUGs (up to +12). I currently do +15-17 in a regular group as moonkin, but there is no lack of tanks in my social M+ circle.

My question:

I've seen that some bears use the Waking Dream azerite trait (can be selected when specced into resto and is active in Guardian specialization also) to improve self-healing a bit. It doesn't strike me as super strong, but may help my bear with self-sustain. The alternative to it is a second Ironfur trait, so the choice is between  3x Twisted Claws + 2x Ironfur and 3x Twisted Claws, 1x Ironfur and 1x Waking Dream for the core traits.

I never really noticed it while playing on my main, since I've always been on top of my gear in this expansion(385+,415+,445+) and the new patches had a good transition from previous mythic level gear to the new heroic+ gear. However recently as I've started to get an alt up to date I've hit a wall around the 400ilvl mark. At this point the only ways to get gear are benthic, raids and m0/+(also arenas kinda). Aside from benthic which is essentially time locked gear, every other option consists of spending 30+min forming a group, doing a run and immediately disbanding, then repeating the process. It really puts a stop to the flow of the game when you're practically waiting for hours to maybe get some gear out of it. Outside of some emissaries there is nothing I can do to further progress my gear, and it sucks.

4659,Banned after Traveling over the Summer for an Internship,"The story:

I was abroad for an internship in Europe for exactly 2 months, during those two months I played retail leading up to Classic for farming entirely gold/getting flying on my main, and I promptly switched to Classic after its release to play that. During that time I played a decent amount, logging probably 4+ hours a day, since the internship was just coding/database work. Either way, I logged a significant amount of time both farming and in Classic during my internship. When I got back to the States I proceeded to log into my account and continue playing. This went on for a week since I was at my parents house after I got back. I then went off to school (university) and a day after I logged into my new apartments wifi - I got an email stating a suspension for ""Unauthorized Account Access""  and mention of account sharing/trading (implying gold farming and etc). This honestly disappointing me because losing my account for 1 month and losing a ton of gold that I intended to use for game time, was quite a set back for the crime of traveling for an internship and being a student with no 'permanent' residence. 

Authenticator Issue (is it useless for these scenarios? appears so...) :

I added an wow app authenticator to my account on my first day at my airBnB, because I figured the extra security for my account/traveling logins was worth the hassle. So my first login abroad and my subsequent logins were all done with an authenticator attached to the account - which is why I am curious is this somehow completely didn't occur/appear important to the moderators who banned my account. I think this might be a cookie cutter approach to my ban since reviewing evidence/account details would reveal that I used an authenticator on day one of traveling. Or is an authenticator useless for these situations?

Appealing the Ban:

I got in touch with support and had a ticket submitted on my behalf with the help of support for appealing the ban through the Appeals Team. I later got an email from the Appeals Team that my appeal was overturned and that 'future inquiries may not be considered... etc etc'. All in one day. This really annoyed me because it seems the time I spent with support and explaining to them that I was willing to provide proof of my stay in said country abroad and plane tickets went to null. I offered proof that I was in fact in the country from where I was accessing my account and they plainly ignored me. It seems that they are either ignorant and trying to resolve this without looking into it, or they are discriminating against the country I visited (known for gold farming/hacking) for my internship with a 'it must be so' attitude towards a foreign IP address. 

Plan for tomorrow/why I posted here:

I plan on getting on the phone this time around and seeing if I can talk to someone who is capable of getting the Appeals Team on the line as well. Or try something of that sort because going through regular support only to get another appeal sent seems to be ineffective strategy for getting this resolved. I posted this here because I my ticket fell through and I am looking for advice on how to resolve this/maybe get in contact with someone who doesn't apply cookie cutter solutions when they see two different IP addresses.

EDIT: I have been getting a lot of comments about me boosting or paying for ‚Äúpilots‚Äù and how its super suspicious that I added an authenticator after I went abroad instead of prior. To clarify - and make this concrete - I have a lot of proof. From plane tickets, to airBnB reservation, to super embarrassing stream/vlogs of me playing Classic while abroad, that I made for my friends back in the States.",1569650709.0,"Banned after Traveling over the Summer for an InternshipThe story:

4691,"Thoughts on the ""Veteran of the Fourth War"" title","**S**o after finishing [Taliesins analysis video](https://youtu.be/Zm76VHI1w4E) about the two new cinematics I noticed that near the end he makes an interesting comment about the fourth war.

During the Negotiation cinematic Saurfang mentioned that they were ""Breaking the cycle"" which I initially wasn't quite sure what he meant but Taliesin takes it as them ending the constant war that has been between the Alliance and Horde which could make sense as it was the same mentality we were left with after rescuing Bane as Thrall asked a similar question to Jaina. Makes sense to me. An end to the war and a rebirth of the Horde that isn't based on lie that Saurfang mentions during his talk with Anduin in the watch tower about ""Blackhands bloody legacy"".

And with plenty of speculation about how the factions will change with 8.3 or 9.0 would it be completely wrong to say that the fourth war wasn't Vanilla or MoP or Legion or any specific expansion but rather just Vanilla-BfA in their entirety? One long continuous war with various lulls and ceasefires in between as we focused our attention on whatever big baddie was threatening our existence at the time? Having one final 15 year long war to possibly end the overarching faction war and let the lines blur a little? 

Of course we still have conflicts in some way with Tyrande and her army of the Dark Moon and Genn on the hunt for Sylvanas and it wouldn't surprise me if there's a handful of Blood Elves still holding an understandable grudge over the Purge of Dalaran.

Does that make sense?

4740,The Horde doesn't need a new Warchief,"**First: What is the Warchief?**


The title of Warchief is the all powerful leader of the Horde. If you exist under the banner of the Horde, you answer to the will of the Warchief. This was satisfactory for the Old Horde because


1: The Old Horde was large majority of Orcs


2: They all had a singular goal, to conquer.


If the Warchief didn't meet the needs of the Horde, the orc with the biggest thralls would challenge them in attempt to take the mantle of Warchief. This ensured a strong bloodthirsty leader kept the Horde on its rampage.


**Why do we still have a Warchief then?**


Because when Thrall was taught about the orcs, they were in a way whitewashed. Blaming all their sins on the demons, Thrall took in the Warsong culture of the Horde without truly understanding it. Including the title of Warchief.


But, as we saw with Thrall and Vol'jin, the Warchief doesn't have to be inherently bloodthirsty. As long as the leader is a good leader, the Horde will do well.


That's called Totalitarianism.


**Big deal, the Alliance has the High King and they don't have this problem.**


The title of High King is an honorary one, it holds no actual power over the other factions under the Alliance's banner. The Alliance is exactly as it is named, an alliance. All the faction leaders opinions matter when it comes to military efforts.


If Garrosh told the Blood Elves to go on suicide missions, he leaves Lor'themar no option but to accept his word, fight him for the title of Warchief, or leave and go to the Alliance (Which he tried to do).


**Conclusion**


So just like the old Horde, the Warchief has to meet the needs of the Horde or risk being overthrown. But the Horde has changed, it no longer agrees on one thing, it has many different cultures and opinions under its banner.


The Horde doesn't need a Warchief, it needs some sort of council of the faction leaders to exist as equals.

4789,There Is A Problem With The Lastest Cinematic [SPOILERS FOR PATCH 8.2.5],"\[Disclaimer: This is my first post on the subreddit. I tried to apply the Flair I think is most appropriate, but I have no idea\]

The cinematic of Saurfang duelling Sylvanas was beautiful, exciting and pretty damn good. It was tense, it showed us some beloved characters, good times. I loved nearly everything about it.

However, there is one problem with that cinematic. One thing that really irks me from an in-fiction perspective, as well as from a Blizzard-to-Players perspective:

**They should not have opened the gates for Saurfang's body.**

Before I continue, - I understand why Blizz made that decision. I understand that the way the story is written, this is where the war starts dying down, where the factionalizing gets put a little on the backburner, and once again the people of the Horde and the Alliance join forces to fight another great existential threat. I understand.

*However...*

Saurfang is a traitor. To every single member of the Horde that stood against him, and his turncoats, Saurfang is a betrayer and an enemy. The idea that everyone would welcome Saurfang through the gate, just because Sylvanas ditched, is insulting to the motivation of everyone who stood against him. It implies that their only motivation was Sylvanas Windrunner herself, and not what she was doing for the Horde. And just as importantly, not the rejection of what Saurfang was doing. This applies both to a character's in-fiction motivation and to the players' reasoning for remaining with the Warchief, during this schism.

Saurfang has recently done great harm to the Horde and his motives are pretty fucking reprehensible.

Saurfang elected to spare the life of Malfurion Stormwind. Soldiers of the Horde suffered and died in that fight. A fight that Saurfang himself planned. And he places his own honour above the sacrifice of those soldiers. Not only is this absurdly selfish, but it is directly harmful to the Horde.

He repeats this selfishness before the siege of Lordaeron, where, were it not for the efforts of Zekhan, he would have given himself up just before battle is joined. That is astoundingly seflish, his surrender would have notably weakened the Horde's ability to defend the city, leading to many more casualties. A somewhat moot point, as we're about to discuss...

When the siege is on, Sylvanas pulls out every stop to prevent The Alliance from taking the walls. She takes out a siege-tower. She personally leads the sally. She sends in an experimental Azerite tank. Only then does she employ the Blight, accepting friendly fire to prevent the walls from falling. Losing the walls means the battle will be much bloodier and the Horde will lose many more people. However Saurfang isn't happy. He wants another solution, but excuse me Saurfang, it's not like Blight was our first choice here. So Sylvanas isn't having his whinging and she uses the Blight. And it works. She breaks the assault and sends the Alliance scattering. Only Jaina's unexpected arrival allows the Alliance to pursue a second assault. And this is where Saurfang firmly cements himself as out for himself and himself only.

During the second assault, Sylvanas leads the inner defense. She asks where Saurfang is. Noone has seen him. Baine hasn't seen him. Where the heck is he? The Horde fights to hold off the Alliance assault, but they get pushed back. Finally Sylvanas calls the retreat, covering for her soldiers, helping as many as she can, survive. And as we enter the keep courtyard, we find Saurfang.

Varok Saurfang. Our High Overlord. Was SULKING. IN. THE. KEEP. While the battle was burning. While Horde soldiers died in defense of eachother and their homes, Varok Saurfang abandoned his command, leaving his people to fend for themselves, so he could go and be really upset about Sylvanas' ""honourless travesty"".

Fuck me that is some intense lack of self-awareness.

At this point, his cowardly, self-serving fairytale honour-obsession is transparently, and agregriously harmful to the Horde. He may well be directly responsible for the fall of Undercity, by his absence from the battlefield. How many more Horde soldiers died, due to the absence of the High Overlord? I always thought Blizzard missed a good opportunity, when they had Zekhan remain enamored with him, instead of growing deeply disillusioned with him.

Anyway, Saurfang doesn't follow the retreat. He stays behind to get his Warrior's Death, even as Sylvanas chastises him for not focusing on the living, telling him that honour is useless to a corpse. If Saurfang had any actual care for the wellbeing of the people of the Horde, this is where he should have realized his mistake. He doesn't. He stays behind, and we witness this witless sacrifice.

Our High Overlord would rather be a prisoner of The Alliance, than contribute to our triumph, if that meant injury to his personal honour.

He then goes on to not kill King Anduin when he had the chance. He becomes a turncoat, working WITH the Alliance, against the Horde. His actions directly cause the deaths of multiple members of the Horde.

He kills scores of Horde soldiers, trying to free fellow traitor Baine Bloodhoof.

And finally, finally, here we are. The people who didn't much appreciate Saurfang's choices, who don't believe that ""But my honour"" makes for good policy vs those who think Saurfang's sense of honour should govern the Horde.

Saurfang, with our long-time enemy in tow, rolls up on Orgrimmar, ready to siege. At this point, every single Horde soldier stood on that wall, and every single non-combatant within it, knows that the army is there to assault the wall. That's why it is there. Because the people commanding it are willing to kill those who stand against them. Because of honour. To them, honour is worth more than the lives of the defenders. And they are led by none other than the High Overtraitor himself, who, as we see above, has repeatedly shown his complete disdain for the lives and political prosperity of the people he is about to besiege, so long as it conflicts with his personal vision of what the Horde should be. And if we won't surrender, he is going to coerce our acceptance of his honour, by force.

Unless you imagine that Saurfang would have turned around and abandoned the attack, if Sylvanas hadn't accepted the challenge, then that is what you have to accept. If you don't think Saurfang would have given up, he must be willing to kill every defender, for the sake of his selfish motivation: His vision, of a horde who conforms to his honour, lives lost be damned.

This is what makes the ending of the cinematic sting. The rest of it is pretty damn good. But for Blizz to say that once the Banshee Queen leaves, everyone just suddenly instantly forgives Saurfang for all the harm he has caused us, for the lives that were lost on his account, for his selfish obsession with his empty and worthless honour. We not only forgive it, but we ceremoniously thump our staves in patriotic self-flaggelation, as we celebrate his heroic entry into Orgrimmar...

Come home to us old hero. We are very sorry we didn't recognize that your honour should govern our decisions. Please, right this way...

Yikes.

...

So, where does that leave us now? What can be done? Not alot, I'm afraid. The damage is done. Every person who stood against Saurfang has had to sit and watch as Blizzard undercut their rightful indignation at the self-serving Orc octogenarian and his precious adherence to ""the way things used to be"". Sit there and watch as we all bow our heads in shame. Because surely we didn't stand with the Warchief because we thought that what mattered was victory over The Alliance? No no. We stood with Sylvanas Windrunner for... no reason... I guess? So when she leaves, we are absent motivation, clearly. And because Saurfang said ""Sylvanas bad"", we must naturally totally accept everything he has done to us as necessary and justified, and worthy of our surrender, and his heroic interment.

Fuck me it's such a bad ending to a good cinematic.

...

The worst part is that Blizzard set themselves up for a pretty good ending, too.

In the in-game cutscene where Saurfang says ""Nono Zappyboi, Orgrimmar isn't our home, Azeroth is"".

Sylvanas could have blasted Saurfang, told the Horde exactly what she thinks of its beastial howling for honour, and then peaced out.  Thrall could have looked to Anduin and said ""We bring him home"", only to be faced with defenders that does not accept that decision. ""No. His body will not cross this gate. He will not be honoured in here. He betrayed us, for his own sake. Banshee Queen or not, he is no hero to us."" Naturally Thrall would make a constipated face and say something like ""Do you know who I am, open the gates"" and we could turn him away. But just as it seems like there might be violence anyway, Zappyboi could save the day, putting a hand on Thrall and being like ""Nono, it's ok. Azeroth was his home"" and we could cut to some gorgeous vista where Saurfang has a burial shrine. Blizz could even make an in-game monument out of it. Maybe we would have our first Orc statue in Stormwind?

I'd forever refer to it as Traitor's Rest, but that's just me.

**His body should not have been welcomed into Orgrimmar.**

So yeah, that was my diatribe about the ending of the cinematic. It was mostly good. But the ending was not very respectful. Not to the in-fiction motivations of the characters. And not to the players.

I hope Blizzard will show more conscientiousness in the future. If you are going to give us choices, please show respect for them, and don't infantilize us for making them.

RIP Saurfang, you were an awesome character, who I found delightfully detestable. I'm very excited to see where the fiction goes from here.

Blizzard does not support this or any other changes you may make to your game files. They know there's a problem and they are working on it. Keep a look out for official updates regarding the issue** [here](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/lag-jittering-with-every-quest-hand-in-level-up/310664/550). 

**This fix may serve as a temporary solution until then but you choose to do so at your own discretion.** 

Hi everyone.

So I've been posting this on the EU forums recently but I've seen the issue on US as well which I do not have access to posting there so thought I'll post here as well:

If you're experiencing freezes and lag turning in quests and completing world quests, looting rares and chests and seemingly random raid freezes etc. and nothing has worked for you, you might want to try this:

Go to your installation location and then: **""\_retail\_""**

Open the **‚ÄúLogs‚Äù** folder.

Find the **Hotfix** file and right click > Properties

Go to **Security**\>Select Everyone>Edit>check **Deny** for everything

Hit apply.

EDIT: **Some people have reported experiencing launching the game from the Battlenet client reverts the permission changes. Try launch the game from the \_retail \_folder instead if this solution didn‚Äôt work the first time. Make sure the game doesn‚Äôt run as administrator.**

EDIT 2: **Blizzard has** [responded](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/lag-jittering-with-every-quest-hand-in-level-up/310664/235?u=katherinea-21503) **to this fix and they do not reccomend using it as it is not the official fix. However, at the current time this seems to be the only workaround so if you do decide to use this for now,** [they reccomend changing it back once an official fix is released.](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/lag-jittering-with-every-quest-hand-in-level-up/310664/238?u=katherinea-21503)

\- **If this didn't work, what then? -**

* The Battlenet client will try to restore the file permissions upon exiting the game or after the changes are made. That's why you want to exit the battlenet client completely and launch wow from the .exe file in the **\_retail\_** folder. Do not launch the game from the bnet client and do not have the client open or in the background while playing. Otherwise your permission changes will most likely not apply to the game as the client will restore them to default. Everytime you open the client, you most likely also have to redo the permission changes to your log file. **Make sure you also have the client closed when you edit your log file permissions so it does not instantly restore them to default.**
* Some people have reported that applying the same changes to the **Tooltip** log file does the trick for them. This file writes a line every time you load the tooltip information of something in the game like creatures, objects, players, UI elements and abilities. It should clear itself upon exiting the game but while playing, it will keep writing and that might cause issues for you so try disabling writing permissions and set to read only if the Hotfix file didn't do the trick. You might also experience faster loading times with this file disabled.
* If you have space, make a backup copy of your game and launch the .exe file from that instead if shutting down the bnet client doesn't prevent the file changes from being reversed.

I have to play from an external SSD so its reading/writing speed is pretty bad. I think there's an issue with log writing since the patch and it affects slower drives because its a lot of lines being written (seemingly error lines) in the short time of just 1 second. This ""fix"" has worked well for me. I have not really seen this kind of solution being brought up in any of the threads I've read so if nothing has worked for you, try this and see if it makes any difference!

Blizzard does not support this or any other changes you may make to your game files. They know there's a problem and they are working on it. Keep a look out for official updates regarding the issue** [here](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/lag-jittering-with-every-quest-hand-in-level-up/310664/550). 

**This fix may serve as a temporary solution until then but you choose to do so at your own discretion.** 

Hi everyone.

So I've been posting this on the EU forums recently but I've seen the issue on US as well which I do not have access to posting there so thought I'll post here as well:

If you're experiencing freezes and lag turning in quests and completing world quests, looting rares and chests and seemingly random raid freezes etc. and nothing has worked for you, you might want to try this:

Go to your installation location and then: **""\_retail\_""**

Open the **‚ÄúLogs‚Äù** folder.

Find the **Hotfix** file and right click > Properties

Go to **Security**\>Select Everyone>Edit>check **Deny** for everything

Hit apply.

EDIT: **Some people have reported experiencing launching the game from the Battlenet client reverts the permission changes. Try launch the game from the \_retail \_folder instead if this solution didn‚Äôt work the first time. Make sure the game doesn‚Äôt run as administrator.**

EDIT 2: **Blizzard has** [responded](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/lag-jittering-with-every-quest-hand-in-level-up/310664/235?u=katherinea-21503) **to this fix and they do not reccomend using it as it is not the official fix. However, at the current time this seems to be the only workaround so if you do decide to use this for now,** [they reccomend changing it back once an official fix is released.](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/lag-jittering-with-every-quest-hand-in-level-up/310664/238?u=katherinea-21503)

\- **If this didn't work, what then? -**

* The Battlenet client will try to restore the file permissions upon exiting the game or after the changes are made. That's why you want to exit the battlenet client completely and launch wow from the .exe file in the **\_retail\_** folder. Do not launch the game from the bnet client and do not have the client open or in the background while playing. Otherwise your permission changes will most likely not apply to the game as the client will restore them to default.

Don't get me wrong I think they are mostly an improvement over the previous models, except for some issues that was really bothering me. 

I would say that the best model in the update is the female worgen model, it is way more emotive and they no longer look like the an angry chihuahua. I was surprised at how great the female worgens actually look in most armor sets, I haven't played one myself and I haven't really seen one lately. However helmets really don't work work on them, they either look really strange or have big clipping issues. Feels like blizzard could have done something about that, but generally a good update in my opinion.

The male worgen model is the most disappointing to me. I have never really liked the male model and the update doesn't seem to have changed that. Between the weird slouch that they do, that makes even the sturdiest of plate armor compress and bend over on itself, to the ginormous shoulders that look really out of place (especially plate ones). I could'n't really find any armor sets that looked great on them or even decent, so in my opinion they lose out on the transmog game entirely. I tried comparing the male worgen model to Genn Greymane in some of the cinematics, some official blizz artwork of worgen and Genn's model in HOTS. There seemed to be a big disconnect anatomically, even between Genn and his own worgen model from in-game wow. It seems to me like there is a big difference between how the male worgens look in-game and how they are supposed to look in universe. I don't know if it was because of missing tech or if blizzard didn't wan't to put the time in to make sweeping changes to the model. I think that it was a bit disappointing that blizzard didn't go for a bigger update, since it is probably the only one we will ever get. However I could also imagine that some people would be mad at a grand update like an entirely new model, because their characters could end up looking a lot different from when the created them.

The new casting animations are really appreciated though.

The goblin female models are sort of good too I guess. They look a lot cleaner now, which can both be a positive or a negative depending on what you prefer. They do, just like the female worgen models, look a lot more emotive and I feel like that is a positive. I could personally find a good amount of sets that they look great in, so no real problem there. I would say that overall it has been a successful update

The male goblin models look really boring though. It suffers really badly from same face syndrome and the uniqueness of some of the older faces have been removed entirely. The cleaner look is welcome, but in this case they look ""too clean"".  Some differing faces would have been nice, even if they were considered ugly by many. 

New customization options would have been greatly appreciated and I find it a bit sad that there was no new options added. An example that could've been splitting the character creation between the human form and the worgen form so you could decide exactly, how you wanted the two forms to look like. The Goblins could perhaps have gotten some new piercings that looked techy or gobliny or some other crazy stuff, they are goblins after all. Well one can hope for more customization options in the future.

To clarify, these are just my opinions and I don't say that any of these opinions are facts.

I would say that the best model in the update is the female worgen model, it is way more emotive and they no longer look like the an angry chihuahua.

He is meant to be one of the toughest Orcs/Warriors in current lore. In 8.2 he was able to lift some wooden post out of the ground and hit a Forsaken a good 10 feet into a wall. His armour was able to block near enough all of the attacks he received. Going back to 6.4 he was able to fight through a swarm of Kalaxxi Mantid (admittedly he got injured while doing so) who are master blademasters what are both strong and swift what were bred for war and killing.

Genn was able to hit Sylvanas around the room where Eyir was with a punch and yet a swing from Saurfang gets parried without Sylvanas even flinching or taken back a bit by the force of the impact.

4927,"[Theory] An unbias retrospective of Sylvanas, the magic she used, and the future of WoW.","Despite the many ideological differences demonstrated by both factions players/NPC's, there remain few objective truths. The first, and most instrumental to understanding what exactly happened is the magic type and strength of magic Sylvanas used at the SvS Mok'gora, that the Thalyssra, Lor'themar and Jaina had never seen or sensed anything like before. Her eyes glow red with hatred, and when Saurfang slashed her with Shalamayne, a mysterious red mist flowed from her wound. So... *why*? and what *is* she?

&nbsp;

For this I looked first at examining the Argus encounter (mythic difficulty) for it's demonstration of what is perhaps the most evident and important example of this mysterious new magic type. Argus was a thematically bizzare fight that seemed, to me at least, entirely out of place for a raid about defeating the Legion. Argus <The Unmaker>. Sargeras had turned him in to a force of universal reckoning and destruction; not merely corruption, as the void or the light do, but...unmaking. It was to undo existence, and bring with it, death.

&nbsp;

At a certain % during the fight, Argus instantly kills the entire raid, and Eonar creates a small green area of foliage for the players to run to and be ressurected. Mythic difficulty adds many mechanics to the final phase, but among them of particular note are the scythes and orbs that add a red and black magic type to the arena. The abilities Argus himself possesses contain a heavy motif of soul, death, and annihilation. I believe this red magic (Death) to be an intentional antithetical magic type to Nature (Life), which is why the players are all executed and sent to the patch of nature to ressurect, and why later on there's a mechanic for ""dead"" (spirit) players in the spirit realm to deal with. A balance of life and death.

&nbsp;

With this said, and ""red magic"" established as Death, we look forwards once more. If you play as a Sylvanas Loyalist, you receive an entirely separate cinematic than the Alliance, and the Saurfang-aligned Horde players. In this cinematic Sylvanas reveals information that was previously witheld. She says to the player;

* ""Countless souls have been fed to the **hungering darkness**"". H.P. Lovecraft uses both ""hungering"" and ""darkness"" to describe C'thulu in his mythos at some points which is undoubtedly the inspiration for the Old Gods in wow. In this case in particular Sylvanas is likely referencing N'zoth. There's also a cosmetic helmet named ""Hood of Hungering Darkness"" which features aggressive red magic themes and an iron chain-like base.

* ""Though I cared nothing for the living, I did pity the Forsaken. For the great injustice that made them what they are. I understand the cruelty of fate better than anyone. But despite all I taught them, they stubbornly clung to hope. To life. They will learn the truth, along with all the rest. My bargain with Azshara will yet bear fruit. The armies of Azeroth will fight her master, and he will line their streets with corpses. In the end, he too will serve Death.""
From the first 5 sentences, we can gather that Sylvanas considers the ""injustice"" life itself. It sounds an awful lot like Sylvanas intends to ""teach"" the denizens of Azeroth that life is inferior to undeath. 

&nbsp;
As for Azshara, and Sylvanas' deal...

Nathanos is clearly seen in the Nazjatar intro cinematic holding, and being guided by Xal'ataths dagger. To Azshara. Where the player will later assist in freeing N'zoth, by way of power stored in the Heart of Azeroth. The ending of the Eternal Palace raid concludes in a cinematic. At one point in it, we see the titan device fall into its socket and immediately the water surrounding the platform turns red, the Titan pillars turn red, and the astral chains break what were the final defensive measures of keeping N'zoth imprisoned. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOKSbPSAjDQ&t=27s

&nbsp;

Death magic, in the magnitude required to turn the seas red and twist devices made by the Titans themselves to prevent an Old God from being freed, would be unfathomable. Between this and her quote from the cinematic ""Countless souls have been fed to the ""hungering darkness"".... I'm lead to believe **Sylvanas has been feeding the souls of those who have been slain to N'zoth. Including that of a certain city-bearing world tree.** It would also explain why Sylvanas had so vehemently sought to annihilate all innocents on Teldrassil, who posed no militaristic threat to her whatsoever. 

&nbsp;

So with this horrible revelation, the question remains as to *why*? Why would she do this?

&nbsp;

Some relevant informtion: In the audio drama ""A Thousand Years of War"" (Part of the 7.3 questchain media release) the narrator states that while the Light sees only one possibility as truth, the Void sees all possibilities as truth. Later in the audiobook when Alleria is being subject to immense void energies the void had presented a vision to her. In it,... "" She saw herself kneeling before the One Who Slumbers beneath Azeroth's waves. She saw herself killing it and taking its place, leading a throng of horrors to consume every nation.""
There is perhaps truth to what the void had shown Alleria, though the key is in the details. It was perhaps not Alleria that was to kill N'zoth and take its power and place, but Sylvanas instead. 
In the Three Sisters comic the void whispered to Alleria demanding she kill Sylvanas immediately as she was a threat to it. N'zoth likely understands Sylvanas' strength and resolve and sought to try to end it prematurely. 

https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/story/comic/windrunner-three-sisters

&nbsp;

Some of, what I feel, is some final relevant context to understanding the mentality of Sylvanas in current times.
From the ""Edge of Night"" short story - 

* ""We are bound to the will of the dormant Lich King. Imprisoned atop Icecrown, possibly for eternity. We hunger for our freedom, as you once hungered for yours."" Annhylde knelt beside Sylvanas, the other Val'kyr clustering around the pair of them, arms linked. ""We need a vessel. One like us. A sister of war. Strong. Who understands life and death. Who has seen the light and the dark. Someone worthy‚Äîworthy of power over life and death.""
""We need you,"" repeated Agatha, her black hair floating freely in the light.

&nbsp;

Also from Edge of Night -

&nbsp;

CONCLUSION: I believe that Sylvanas' prime motivations are to bring death to every living thing on Azeroth and possibly beyond, and raise it into undeath. She wants this because, in a sick and twisted way, she genuinely believes it's preferable to dying outright, and that she's helping Azeroth. This mentality likely stems from the horrors she had experienced when she had truly died after throwing herself off Icecrown Citadel (and shattering her forsaken soul on the saronite-constructed spires) in the ""Edge of Night"" story. 

&nbsp;

DETAILED BATTLE FOR AZEROTH EXPLANATION (CONJECTURE):

&nbsp;

She, very early on, had sought the eternal life of herself and her followers, so that they had never need to see or experience what she had. This was made manifest with her pact with Helya to obtain the Soulcage to enslave Eyir, which would give her forsaken eternal life. Genn put an end to this plan, shattering the Soulcage in Eyir's vault. She then had to resort to other means to secure her peoples future. At some point, she decided that freeing N'zoth to kill and/or enslave him was necessary for her to gain ultimate power over Life and Death that has been hinted at for so long. She convinced Saurfang of a plan to invade Teldrassil as well as general warmongering as a means of harvesting new souls to feed N'zoth. At some point just before or after the events of the Siege of Boralus, Sylvanas would've been made aware of Lady Ashvane's connection with Azshara (the sea monsters that invade are made apparent to be void minions of the deep) and arranged a meeting with her (Horde campaign showcases this). From this, Sylvanas gains new information on Azshara and her intimate relationship with N'zoth. Ashvane was likely falsely promised glory, riches, and power for this exchange (given Ashvanes personality), and is delivered to Azshara at some point between Siege of Boralus and us players having visited Nazjatar for the first time, with Genn/Nathanos leading the charge for your respective factions. Xal'ataths dagger washes ashore conveniently just for the player to take, who is then freed and finds a body to physically manifest in, and  the dagger finds ownership with Sylvanas. Sylvanas refers to Xal'ataths dagger as ""a torch that shall light our path forward."" which is a quote echoed by Il'gynoth, and visually demonstrated by Nathanos in the 8.2 intro cinematic. The dagger eventually leads players to Nazjatar, then to the Eternal Palace where exists the titan console responsible for keeping N'zoth chained. The combination of the Azerite present in our necklaces and the souls fed to N'zoth from Teldrassil and other slain soldiers free him for Azeroth to deal with. Sylvanas believes, with N'zoth freed, she can control him in a similar vein to Azshara to either use or claim his power. Alleria then feels his presence all around her in the Alliance/Horde Saurfang-aligned campaign arc. Sylvanas demonstrates her immense mastery of Death magic in the Mak'gora vs Saurfang, and echoes what she said to Delaryn, that hope dies. By this she means hope of life and living; that death, to her, is inevitable and eternal. And that by her machinations and schemes, she will...free them from something she sees as a burden or weakness. 

&nbsp;

This explains many quotes from Il'gynoth. 

So going forward, what does this mean? 

&nbsp;

It means we, as Azerothians, have much greater threats to deal with in the future than just our factional enemies (Horde or Alliance). Blizzard has, for the past few patches / expansion(s), been establishing each cosmic magic type as truly morally grey. Demon Hunters, warlocks, and the Krokuul wield the power of Fel, which the Legion uses against all of creation. The Light sought to bind and transform Illidan to its own means and presumably succeeded in forcibly converting the entirety of AU Draenor to wield and use, and be ***corrupted*** by light. The list goes on. I believe the future of WoW will highlight the objective ""good"" and ""evil"" of both death and void (and perhaps the rest) as N'zoth and Sylvanas look to dominate one another.

&nbsp;

""Malfurion Stormrage yells: I Pray that purging the Nightmare's corruption buys us enough time to defeat the Legion and catch our breath before the black armies rise up from the depths.""",1569562323.0,"[Theory] An unbias retrospective of Sylvanas, the magic she used, and the future of WoW.Despite the many ideological differences demonstrated by both factions players/NPC's, there remain few objective truths. The first, and most instrumental to understanding what exactly happened is the magic type and strength of magic Sylvanas used at the SvS Mok'gora, that the Thalyssra, Lor'themar and Jaina had never seen or sensed anything like before. Her eyes glow red with hatred, and when Saurfang slashed her with Shalamayne, a mysterious red mist flowed from her wound. So... *why*? and what *is* she?

&nbsp;

For this I looked first at examining the Argus encounter (mythic difficulty) for it's demonstration of what is perhaps the most evident and important example of this mysterious new magic type. Argus was a thematically bizzare fight that seemed, to me at least, entirely out of place for a raid about defeating the Legion. Argus <The Unmaker>. Sargeras had turned him in to a force of universal reckoning and destruction; not merely corruption, as the void or the light do, but...unmaking. It was to undo existence, and bring with it, death.

&nbsp;

At a certain % during the fight, Argus instantly kills the entire raid, and Eonar creates a small green area of foliage for the players to run to and be ressurected. Mythic difficulty adds many mechanics to the final phase, but among them of particular note are the scythes and orbs that add a red and black magic type to the arena. The abilities Argus himself possesses contain a heavy motif of soul, death, and annihilation. I believe this red magic (Death) to be an intentional antithetical magic type to Nature (Life), which is why the players are all executed and sent to the patch of nature to ressurect, and why later on there's a mechanic for ""dead"" (spirit) players in the spirit realm to deal with. A balance of life and death.

&nbsp;

With this said, and ""red magic"" established as Death, we look forwards once more. If you play as a Sylvanas Loyalist, you receive an entirely separate cinematic than the Alliance, and the Saurfang-aligned Horde players. In this cinematic Sylvanas reveals information that was previously witheld. She says to the player;

* ""Countless souls have been fed to the **hungering darkness**"". H.P. Lovecraft uses both ""hungering"" and ""darkness"" to describe C'thulu in his mythos at some points which is undoubtedly the inspiration for the Old Gods in wow. In this case in particular Sylvanas is likely referencing N'zoth. There's also a cosmetic helmet named ""Hood of Hungering Darkness"" which features aggressive red magic themes and an iron chain-like base.

* ""Though I cared nothing for the living, I did pity the Forsaken. For the great injustice that made them what they are. I understand the cruelty of fate better than anyone. But despite all I taught them, they stubbornly clung to hope. To life. They will learn the truth, along with all the rest. My bargain with Azshara will yet bear fruit. The armies of Azeroth will fight her master, and he will line their streets with corpses. In the end, he too will serve Death.""
From the first 5 sentences, we can gather that Sylvanas considers the ""injustice"" life itself. It sounds an awful lot like Sylvanas intends to ""teach"" the denizens of Azeroth that life is inferior to undeath. 

&nbsp;
As for Azshara, and Sylvanas' deal...

Nathanos is clearly seen in the Nazjatar intro cinematic holding, and being guided by Xal'ataths dagger. To Azshara. Where the player will later assist in freeing N'zoth, by way of power stored in the Heart of Azeroth. The ending of the Eternal Palace raid concludes in a cinematic. At one point in it, we see the titan device fall into its socket and immediately the water surrounding the platform turns red, the Titan pillars turn red, and the astral chains break what were the final defensive measures of keeping N'zoth imprisoned. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOKSbPSAjDQ&t=27s

&nbsp;

Death magic, in the magnitude required to turn the seas red and twist devices made by the Titans themselves to prevent an Old God from being freed, would be unfathomable. Between this and her quote from the cinematic ""Countless souls have been fed to the ""hungering darkness"".... I'm lead to believe **Sylvanas has been feeding the souls of those who have been slain to N'zoth. Including that of a certain city-bearing world tree.** It would also explain why Sylvanas had so vehemently sought to annihilate all innocents on Teldrassil, who posed no militaristic threat to her whatsoever. 

&nbsp;

So with this horrible revelation, the question remains as to *why*? Why would she do this?

&nbsp;

Some relevant informtion: In the audio drama ""A Thousand Years of War"" (Part of the 7.3 questchain media release) the narrator states that while the Light sees only one possibility as truth, the Void sees all possibilities as truth. Later in the audiobook when Alleria is being subject to immense void energies the void had presented a vision to her. In it,... "" She saw herself kneeling before the One Who Slumbers beneath Azeroth's waves. She saw herself killing it and taking its place, leading a throng of horrors to consume every nation.""
There is perhaps truth to what the void had shown Alleria, though the key is in the details. It was perhaps not Alleria that was to kill N'zoth and take its power and place, but Sylvanas instead. 
In the Three Sisters comic the void whispered to Alleria demanding she kill Sylvanas immediately as she was a threat to it. N'zoth likely understands Sylvanas' strength and resolve and sought to try to end it prematurely. 

https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/story/comic/windrunner-three-sisters

&nbsp;

Some of, what I feel, is some final relevant context to understanding the mentality of Sylvanas in current times.
From the ""Edge of Night"" short story - 

* ""We are bound to the will of the dormant Lich King. Imprisoned atop Icecrown, possibly for eternity. We hunger for our freedom, as you once hungered for yours."" Annhylde knelt beside Sylvanas, the other Val'kyr clustering around the pair of them, arms linked. ""We need a vessel. One like us. A sister of war. Strong. Who understands life and death. Who has seen the light and the dark. Someone worthy‚Äîworthy of power over life and death.""
""We need you,"" repeated Agatha, her black hair floating freely in the light.

&nbsp;

Also from Edge of Night - 

* ""...Her eyes were alive, their oversized jet-black pupils livid with rage, red embers glowing deep within.
At that moment, nobody dared look Sylvanas Windrunner in the eye. Nobody but Garrosh Hellscream.
What he saw was a great black void, an infinite darkness. There was fear in those eyes, but also something else. Something that terrified even the great warchief. His wolf began to edge away instinctively.
""Garrosh Hellscream. I've walked the realms of the dead. I have seen the infinite dark. Nothing you say. Or do. Could possibly frighten me.""

&nbsp;

CONCLUSION: I believe that Sylvanas' prime motivations are to bring death to every living thing on Azeroth and possibly beyond, and raise it into undeath.

4934,Sylvanas in 8.2.5.,"In ""Loyalist"" cutscene ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AUpwFZKC38)), Sylvanas Windrunner, having fled from Orgrimmar, says a few interesting things:

* Countless souls have been fed to the hungering darkness. 
* My bargain will Azshara will yet bear fruit. The armies of Azeroth will fight her master, and he will line their streets with corpses.
* In the end, he too will serve Death.

These three are the most intriguing ones. I'm interesting about other opinions on this, and the whole thing Sylvanas is hinting at in new patch.

1. ""The hungering darkness"", this should be an obvious reference to N'zoth, right? Personally, I think it would be too obvious if it was him, and this is probably a reference to Helya, since she (presumably defeated) and her influence/presence was hinted at during BfA once already, in ""Ring of the Reefs"" questline and by Valdemar Stormseeker himself, so I don't see why this couldn't be a way to include her in the mainstream storyline once again, since Legion. Even Valdemar states that you can't kill death, when talking about Helya, so she's probably still lurking out there. These ""countless souls"" are probably souls of the deceased that died during this Alliance/Horde war, and are feeding Helya and giving her more strength and power. This would also somwhat fit in relatively recent [rumours about 9.0 being about Shadowlands and having Helya as one of the main characters](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-shadowlands-is-this-the-next-warcraft-expansion/65120).
2. What bargain with Azshara exactly? I remember her having a deal with Helya, but we know nothing about what the deal was, not a single detail... It's surprising to see this, unless I'm missing an important piece of recent lore, I don't know what deal between Sylvanas and Azshara went on. As for the second sentence, it might sound dumb, but it seems Sylvanas is playing a game with words here. Is the pronoun ""her"" referring to Azshara (and by that extension, her master, N'Zoth) or Azeroth, as in the Titan Azeroth? Most likely the former, but it's fun to speculate about this, could Titans have superiors, as Sylvanas could possibly be hinting at?
3. Assuming the second quote is talking about Azshara's master, N'Zoth, and, with all the hints about Helya being death, could this be a hint to N'Zoth inferiority when compared to Helya? Will N'Zoth eventually serve Death (Helya) too? Would all Old Gods or Titans server it/her?

4936,My Predictions,"This is purely speculative but here are my thoughts on the following characters' future and/or reasons.

&#x200B;

Tyrande: We have not seen the last of her. She has experienced a lot in her lifetime and Sylvanas triggered her to go Night Warrior. I don't see how she wouldn't be a raid boss, but I hope she's not. She will not forgive the Horde for what they've done just because Saurfang sacrificed himself and green man says ""sorry"". Whether we (the Horde) were in favor of Teldrassil's burning at the moment it happened (not after the fact while weighing the possible reasons) or not, we ALL marched through Night Elf lands, killed Night Elves with extreme prejudice and helped Sylvanas reach the point where she could give the order to burn Teldrassil. We Horde players (who enjoy doing their own head canon or RP) will have to live with that decision. I was all in favor of the war of Thorns up until the tree burnt. In that moment I was pissed at what I did. then I spent the remainder of the xpac trying to justify my actions for continuing to support Sylvanas. Simply put there is no justification. I, along with countless others, erred greatly. In my opinion, Tyrande is in full right of retribution. 

&#x200B;

Sylvanas: She did not rage quit (sorry for the slang). She has had a plan this whole time, but it's been continuously changing. I can't recall who said it as I've read a LOT of Reddit recently since the Cinematic, but she is doing this for a ""greater purpose"". Like most Greater Good schemes though, its incredibly selfish and small minded. (Cue Shawn of The Dead flashbacks...""THE GREATER GOOD"") I do not think she had intended on leaving so abruptly. I believe her plan was to fight, but the moment Saurfang trapped her was when he gave her an open shot in killing him in front of everyone. When she got cut it was just after he began to rebound and her outburst ""The Horde is NOTHING"" slipped. I do think she said this because, as someone else stated, she sees the greater threat and thinks as awesome and honorable as it is to go into battle with swords and shields and stand united in our neat looking armor that it won;t matter one bit. In her mind, what's coming is so terrible that not even the only force in the Universe to stop Sargeras can comprehend what theyre about to be up against. So the moment she said this she realized that no matter what she said or how she retraced and tried to clarify....it wouldnt matter. She was literally in the middle of two armies that now BOTH sides questioned her authority. So she doubled down on the nothing speech to unite them against a common enemy. Her. Does this justify her actions? No. She could have decided to not be so secretive and just fricken be honest with the others. Also in the moment she said the Horde was nothing, I think she immediately regretted it. It didnt truly reflect her feelings. Now I know after the fact she meets with her champion at windrunner spire and says everything goes according to plan but Sylvanas always has moments her ""good"" side comes out, her softer side. Like in Three Sisters, she chooses to spare her sisters life from entering death so that they may enjoy what they love in life just a bit longer. When you take the necklace and give it to her as a loqw level blood elf, she sings her lament then after singing looks at the pendants and hastily turns away. Personally I think she cant stand being undead so she does whatever she can to forget what living is all about and focuses more and more on death and thus becomes more and more twisted. She is not a hero though, she is very much a villain. Either she will go into the shadowlands to ensure our doom or to be a dark savior. She cannot be considered anything less than an enemy at this point though.

&#x200B;

Bolvar: Technically this isn't really applicable til 10.0, but I think while we are in the shadowlands the Black Empire will spread (shocking, I know). However when were are out of the shadowlands and back on Azeroth we either find one or two places unconquered by the Old Gods. Pandaria and/or Northrend. The Pandarens have dealt with the Sha for centuries and would have a natural resilience to it. This is where most likely our forces would regroup at first. Our second forwarding base would be in Northrend where bolvar still reigns as King and has been giving the Old Gods hell. He is an active Lich King at that time. His death Knights along with much of the Ebon Blade fighton the field and the scourge isnt as mindless as they were with Arthas. He may even have the help of Bwonsamdi and his death magic. I think this is why he is building up his armies, getting the horse man back and all that. It's to gear up for the real enemy that he see coming, the same as Sylvanas but not nearly as self destructive. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, thoughts?",1569560776.0,"My PredictionsThis is purely speculative but here are my thoughts on the following characters' future and/or reasons.

&#x200B;

Tyrande: We have not seen the last of her. She has experienced a lot in her lifetime and Sylvanas triggered her to go Night Warrior. I don't see how she wouldn't be a raid boss, but I hope she's not. She will not forgive the Horde for what they've done just because Saurfang sacrificed himself and green man says ""sorry"". Whether we (the Horde) were in favor of Teldrassil's burning at the moment it happened (not after the fact while weighing the possible reasons) or not, we ALL marched through Night Elf lands, killed Night Elves with extreme prejudice and helped Sylvanas reach the point where she could give the order to burn Teldrassil. We Horde players (who enjoy doing their own head canon or RP) will have to live with that decision. I was all in favor of the war of Thorns up until the tree burnt. In that moment I was pissed at what I did. then I spent the remainder of the xpac trying to justify my actions for continuing to support Sylvanas. Simply put there is no justification. I, along with countless others, erred greatly. In my opinion, Tyrande is in full right of retribution. 

&#x200B;

Sylvanas: She did not rage quit (sorry for the slang). She has had a plan this whole time, but it's been continuously changing. I can't recall who said it as I've read a LOT of Reddit recently since the Cinematic, but she is doing this for a ""greater purpose"". Like most Greater Good schemes though, its incredibly selfish and small minded. (Cue Shawn of The Dead flashbacks...""THE GREATER GOOD"") I do not think she had intended on leaving so abruptly. I believe her plan was to fight, but the moment Saurfang trapped her was when he gave her an open shot in killing him in front of everyone. When she got cut it was just after he began to rebound and her outburst ""The Horde is NOTHING"" slipped. I do think she said this because, as someone else stated, she sees the greater threat and thinks as awesome and honorable as it is to go into battle with swords and shields and stand united in our neat looking armor that it won;t matter one bit. In her mind, what's coming is so terrible that not even the only force in the Universe to stop Sargeras can comprehend what theyre about to be up against. So the moment she said this she realized that no matter what she said or how she retraced and tried to clarify....it wouldnt matter. She was literally in the middle of two armies that now BOTH sides questioned her authority. So she doubled down on the nothing speech to unite them against a common enemy. Her. Does this justify her actions? No. She could have decided to not be so secretive and just fricken be honest with the others. Also in the moment she said the Horde was nothing, I think she immediately regretted it. It didnt truly reflect her feelings. Now I know after the fact she meets with her champion at windrunner spire and says everything goes according to plan but Sylvanas always has moments her ""good"" side comes out, her softer side. Like in Three Sisters, she chooses to spare her sisters life from entering death so that they may enjoy what they love in life just a bit longer. When you take the necklace and give it to her as a loqw level blood elf, she sings her lament then after singing looks at the pendants and hastily turns away. Personally I think she cant stand being undead so she does whatever she can to forget what living is all about and focuses more and more on death and thus becomes more and more twisted. She is not a hero though, she is very much a villain. Either she will go into the shadowlands to ensure our doom or to be a dark savior. She cannot be considered anything less than an enemy at this point though.

&#x200B;

Bolvar: Technically this isn't really applicable til 10.0, but I think while we are in the shadowlands the Black Empire will spread (shocking, I know). However when were are out of the shadowlands and back on Azeroth we either find one or two places unconquered by the Old Gods. Pandaria and/or Northrend. The Pandarens have dealt with the Sha for centuries and would have a natural resilience to it. This is where most likely our forces would regroup at first. Our second forwarding base would be in Northrend where bolvar still reigns as King and has been giving the Old Gods hell. He is an active Lich King at that time. His death Knights along with much of the Ebon Blade fighton the field and the scourge isnt as mindless as they were with Arthas. He may even have the help of Bwonsamdi and his death magic. I think this is why he is building up his armies, getting the horse man back and all that.

4985,Justification for War,"From what I recall reading in Before the Storm, and correct me if I'm wrong (the book was stolen from me before I finished it) but we got an internal dialogue from Sylvanas at one point to justify the war.

4992,I really hope that Bolvar shows up next expac,"I'm tired of them putting in so much effort and build up into him, but to only still have him frozen.

I hope he gets a big spotlight next expac.

But not killable. Death knights still need a main leader. The deathlord is great but all she really is doing is putting Bolvar's plan into place and making it happen. We still need a leader that can handle and actually do the necessary evil and not just be evil.(Plus he's just a badass)

4993,8.2.5 spoiler question.,"So as the title implies i have a question about the events of 8.2.5. been trying to see if others have asked but i haven't been able to find anything, however i do apologize if this has already been asked.

I should also add i haven't played through it yet, but have watched most if not all of it online.

After the cinematic Sylvanas flies off and the players that followed her go along and should now be branded traitors to the new Horde. How does that actually work gameplay wise. you can't be locked out of all of the major cities, but at the same time ignoring the fact that you literally just killed innocent civilians can't be ignored. 

so my question is how are these characters handled in game?",1569549346.0,"8.2.5 spoiler question.So as the title implies i have a question about the events of 8.2.5. been trying to see if others have asked but i haven't been able to find anything, however i do apologize if this has already been asked.

4996,Character selection screen update - Am I reading into this to much?,"For 15 years the character select screen has been mostly the same. At one point the backgrounds get updated so everyone has their own feel to it. Later we get the chance to re-organize the list. Now with 8.2.5 classes are color coded on the select screen but the big change to me is seeing the factions listed for each character. Players have speculated that a faction split or doing away with factions was coming. If we have been able to get along for 15 years without seeing a horde symbol next to orcs and undead or an alliance symbol next to humans and elves, the only reason I can think of adding it would be a change in the factions themselves. 

Anyone else getting that vibe?",1569548534.0,"Character selection screen update - Am I reading into this to much?For 15 years the character select screen has been mostly the same.
