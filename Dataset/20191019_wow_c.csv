# Temper(ing) Expectations

It's 2019 bois, people play different than they did in 2005. I want dungeons to be quick, and most likely to do them a few times in a row.

&#x200B;

**This is not a wrong mentality.**

&#x200B;

To achieve this kind of speed, you're going to need to give up the idea that you're going to be able to tank every single add. You're also going to need to realize that you need to be decked out head to toe in defensive slanted gear.

&#x200B;

**If you're using PUGs to do the majority of your 5 mans at this point, you should know by now what that entails.**

* Not everyone is going to be on the skill level that you think you are. (You're not, I'm not, nobody is. Leave your ego at the door.)
* Not everyone is going to know what everything does.
* Not everyone is going to know when to apply more DPS and when to slow down.

# Talent Choices

&#x200B;

This is my current build for both raid and 5 man tanking - [http://classicdb.ch/?talent#LV0xzZVZEizoezzVo](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#LV0xzZVZEizoezzVo)

&#x200B;

This has been done to death, but i'm going to briefly go through what might be misunderstood.

* Tactical Mastery / Anger Management - You'll need these to tank the way I'm explaining throughout this guide. Stance Dancing is important and th is facilitates.
* Cruelty - I don't care that much about damage, but this is a huge amount for 5 points.
* Imp Shield Block 1/3 - Don't ever put more points into this than 2, it increases the time the buff is on you, not how many blocks you get.
* Imp Sunder / Imp Taunt - You can mix and match how you want to build this, imp taunt is my last point I put in. I like my sunders cheap because I use them a ton.
* Anticipation - This talent is fine. If you want to only tank 5 mans, you can go down none and pick up more utility if you want.
* Imp shield wall - this is useless, 2 points to slightly prolong a 30 minute CD is a waste.

# Rage Management - Getting Angry

Threat issues start here, not having enough rage, so what can we do about it?

&#x200B;

We've got a few abilities to generate, so lets go over them and what they do for us.

&#x200B;

Charge - Sometimes we can't, especially in dungeons like Stratholme, where mobs are packed in tight and patrols can lead to some real trouble.

Blood Rage - Excellent rage generation, small burst and some over time. We want to use this on cooldown, until the pull is almost over. If you're on the last 20% of a pull, sit on this, especially if you notice your healer needs mana. Use it to maintain while out of combat.

Berserker Rage - This one is hidden in berserker stance, but you still want to reach for it, the amount of damage you take swapping into/out of stance is pretty negligible.

Auto Attack - If every swing window, you aren't getting a hit in, you're not not only losing on rage, but threat.

&#x200B;

It probably seems silly to say this, but don't waste rage. If the pack of mobs is low and under control, stop spending.

&#x200B;

Don't stance change if you're > 25. Use SOMETHING, shout, slam, sunder. Wasting our hard to come by resource is very easy to do and very costly.

 

**Initial Pull** 

So lets go into the two typical pulls, the charge pull and the LOS pull.

&#x200B;

Charge Pull - We're going to have some extra rage here, so lets plan out what it looks like.

&#x200B;

Charge -> Demo Shout -> Shield Slam Skull 

This should put as at below 25 rage, so lets swap to defensive stance and pop bloodrage

Now typically this is about the time your DPS start to open up, and you don't have enough GCD's right now to hold everything in place. This is where we want to concussive blow an elite and taunt another one.

We've got one stationary and two attacking us most likely. So this is where you're going to want to sunder.

Our rage is going to start to dip low here after a few sunders, so take a second here and pop into berserker stance and use berserker rage. (Don't do this if mobs in the pack can fear)

From here, pop back into defensive stance, taunt something, shield slam something and start sundering.

&#x200B;

This should get you through the pull, notice what we haven't hit?

&#x200B;

LOS Pull - We'll have less rage here, but we're going to have the mobs clumped up a lot nicer.

 

The key to high threat on LOS pulls, is to have preserved some rage from the previous group. It's going to be a bit of a challenge without it. You can pop blood rage and let that ride out to get it on CD and have some initial rage.

If your rage is below 25 as mobs are closing in, you can swap to berserker and pop berserker rage.

 

# Priority Abilities - Stop Hitting That

So, you can probably tell by now. I don't care about damage dealt as a tank, and in 5 mans, neither should you. You should naturally do about 80-140 DPS with auto attacks, shield slam, and revenge.

&#x200B;

These are the rage spending abilities you should be using.

&#x200B;

* Shield Slam - Use this on cooldown, put it on CD as early as you can in the pull so you can use it again.
* Revenge - Use this on cooldown, you don't have much control over when it pops, but be sure to tab to a mob you could use extra threat on.
* Taunt - Use this as a tool on the initial pull to force a mob to attack you, and then ignore that mob.
* Sunder - The Hallmark warrior ability, focus this on the elite mobs first, cycling through each
* Concussive Blow - Use this to stun a mob on the pull while you generate rage on the others, then taunt it when gets out of the stun. 
* Demoralizing Shout - Puts a small amount of threat on non-elite mobs, will give you enough time so that your healer doesn't get murdered. (Don't spam this)

&#x200B;

I'm going to go ahead and go through this part quickly, but these are the spenders you shouldn't bother with.

&#x200B;

* Thunder Clap - Mobs attack slower and you generate less rage, the damage caused by this is low and isn't worth the rage
* Heroic Strike - If you aren't sitting at 80+ rage, don't even think about it. The heroic strike auto attack doesn't generate rage, it costs more than the tooltip says it does.
* Cleave - Cleave is a lot better than heroic strike on the fights that you're rage flooded. This has much higher priority to use than heroic strike, but still use sparingly. (You should be looking to save the rage for the next pull)
* Shield Block - Shield block is for raids to avoid getting crushing blows. It's not worth it, the damage mitigated by blocks is low.
* Rend - Take it off your bar, it's worse than sunder and you would apply it in the same scenario.

# Tanking What Matters

So if you've been paying close attention, I mention elites a bit throughout what we've already covered. That's because these are the mobs that matter.

&#x200B;

Lets talk about a typical pack in stratholme, 3 elite zombies and a handful of non-elite skeletons.

&#x200B;

We're going to mark 2 of the elites here. Skull will be where you shield slam, X will be where you taunt and unmarked will be your stun target.

These are the 3 mobs where we're going to put the majority of our resources into managing. The others don't hit that hard and die quickly, give them an average effort to manage.

We should be relying on our DPS to clean up the non elites, your job is to pile them ontop of whatever caster mobs exist so their cleave can get it. This is what they are good at, and this is what they are going to do anyways, utilize them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Wearing The ""Right"" Gear

I'm going to lose some people here, but this is a link to what my warrior wears for 5 mans. [https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/rMFFGkLMFqgBJz47h4enVZ](https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/rMFFGkLMFqgBJz47h4enVZ)

This is by NO MEANS me flexing, or suggesting you need to be remotely this geared. I just want you to notice the 3 pieces of mail gear I have equipped.

&#x200B;

* Slashclaw Bracers +1% hit
* Voone's Vice Grips +2% hit
* Bloodmail Boots + 1% hit

&#x200B;

Now, I have plate epics that I can wear in these slots, but none of them compare to how good these 3 pieces are. 4% hit in 3 pieces of gear insane. (I MT Ony/MC with these equipped). Farm these, farm these 3 pieces and you will not believe the difference it makes. The \~300 armor you're going to lose is so negligible in comparison to the hit you gain.

&#x200B;

You don't need to be as beefy as you think you need to be (Sorry healers!). Prioritize hit over everything. Missing moves not only wastes some rage, but it wastes precious GCD's. More hit means more rage as well, since your auto attacks will connect more.

&#x200B;

# Developing Relationships

You hate it, I hate it, PUG groups are the worst. You never know what to expect and it makes you anxious.

&#x200B;

**So stop, stop PUGGING.**

&#x200B;

It's not that easy, of course. Join a guild, you're in demand, even if you don't want to raid with them, join a guild. MAKE SOME FRIENDS.

People will be all over you to tank 5 mans for them. Do it, show up, try hard, make connections.

&#x200B;

That's what the game is about right, making connections. Be nice, get in discord and have a good time. You'll become known and you'll have those people to do 5 mans with.

 And lets be honest, if you haven't developed at least a few relationships along the way to 60... **Maybe it's you.**

So lets go into the two typical pulls, the charge pull and the LOS pull.

&#x200B;

Charge Pull - We're going to have some extra rage here, so lets plan out what it looks like.

&#x200B;

Charge -> Demo Shout -> Shield Slam Skull 

This should put as at below 25 rage, so lets swap to defensive stance and pop bloodrage

Now typically this is about the time your DPS start to open up, and you don't have enough GCD's right now to hold everything in place. This is where we want to concussive blow an elite and taunt another one.

We've got one stationary and two attacking us most likely. So this is where you're going to want to sunder.

Our rage is going to start to dip low here after a few sunders, so take a second here and pop into berserker stance and use berserker rage. (Don't do this if mobs in the pack can fear)

From here, pop back into defensive stance, taunt something, shield slam something and start sundering.

&#x200B;

This should get you through the pull, notice what we haven't hit?

&#x200B;

LOS Pull - We'll have less rage here, but we're going to have the mobs clumped up a lot nicer.

 

The key to high threat on LOS pulls, is to have preserved some rage from the previous group. It's going to be a bit of a challenge without it. You can pop blood rage and let that ride out to get it on CD and have some initial rage.

If your rage is below 25 as mobs are closing in, you can swap to berserker and pop berserker rage.

 

# Priority Abilities - Stop Hitting That

So, you can probably tell by now. I don't care about damage dealt as a tank, and in 5 mans, neither should you. You should naturally do about 80-140 DPS with auto attacks, shield slam, and revenge.

&#x200B;

These are the rage spending abilities you should be using.

&#x200B;

* Shield Slam - Use this on cooldown, put it on CD as early as you can in the pull so you can use it again.
* Revenge - Use this on cooldown, you don't have much control over when it pops, but be sure to tab to a mob you could use extra threat on.
* Taunt - Use this as a tool on the initial pull to force a mob to attack you, and then ignore that mob.
* Sunder - The Hallmark warrior ability, focus this on the elite mobs first, cycling through each
* Concussive Blow - Use this to stun a mob on the pull while you generate rage on the others, then taunt it when gets out of the stun. 
* Demoralizing Shout - Puts a small amount of threat on non-elite mobs, will give you enough time so that your healer doesn't get murdered. (Don't spam this)

&#x200B;

I'm going to go ahead and go through this part quickly, but these are the spenders you shouldn't bother with.

&#x200B;

* Thunder Clap - Mobs attack slower and you generate less rage, the damage caused by this is low and isn't worth the rage
* Heroic Strike - If you aren't sitting at 80+ rage, don't even think about it. The heroic strike auto attack doesn't generate rage, it costs more than the tooltip says it does.
* Cleave - Cleave is a lot better than heroic strike on the fights that you're rage flooded. This has much higher priority to use than heroic strike, but still use sparingly. (You should be looking to save the rage for the next pull)
* Shield Block - Shield block is for raids to avoid getting crushing blows. It's not worth it, the damage mitigated by blocks is low.
* Rend - Take it off your bar, it's worse than sunder and you would apply it in the same scenario.

# Tanking What Matters

So if you've been paying close attention, I mention elites a bit throughout what we've already covered. That's because these are the mobs that matter.

&#x200B;

Lets talk about a typical pack in stratholme, 3 elite zombies and a handful of non-elite skeletons.

&#x200B;

We're going to mark 2 of the elites here. Skull will be where you shield slam, X will be where you taunt and unmarked will be your stun target.

These are the 3 mobs where we're going to put the majority of our resources into managing. The others don't hit that hard and die quickly, give them an average effort to manage.

We should be relying on our DPS to clean up the non elites, your job is to pile them ontop of whatever caster mobs exist so their cleave can get it. This is what they are good at, and this is what they are going to do anyways, utilize them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Wearing The ""Right"" Gear

I'm going to lose some people here, but this is a link to what my warrior wears for 5 mans. [https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/rMFFGkLMFqgBJz47h4enVZ](https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/rMFFGkLMFqgBJz47h4enVZ)

This is by NO MEANS me flexing, or suggesting you need to be remotely this geared. I just want you to notice the 3 pieces of mail gear I have equipped.

&#x200B;

* Slashclaw Bracers +1% hit
* Voone's Vice Grips +2% hit
* Bloodmail Boots + 1% hit

&#x200B;

Now, I have plate epics that I can wear in these slots, but none of them compare to how good these 3 pieces are. 4% hit in 3 pieces of gear insane. (I MT Ony/MC with these equipped). Farm these, farm these 3 pieces and you will not believe the difference it makes. The \~300 armor you're going to lose is so negligible in comparison to the hit you gain.

&#x200B;

You don't need to be as beefy as you think you need to be (Sorry healers!). Prioritize hit over everything. Missing moves not only wastes some rage, but it wastes precious GCD's. More hit means more rage as well, since your auto attacks will connect more.

&#x200B;

# Developing Relationships

You hate it, I hate it, PUG groups are the worst. You never know what to expect and it makes you anxious.

&#x200B;

**So stop, stop PUGGING.**

&#x200B;

It's not that easy, of course. Join a guild, you're in demand, even if you don't want to raid with them, join a guild. MAKE SOME FRIENDS.

People will be all over you to tank 5 mans for them. Do it, show up, try hard, make connections.

&#x200B;

That's what the game is about right, making connections. Be nice, get in discord and have a good time. You'll become known and you'll have those people to do 5 mans with.

 And lets be honest, if you haven't developed at least a few relationships along the way to 60... **Maybe it's you.**

&#x200B;

**If you have any questions, feel free to leave a reply and I will do my best to respond.**",0

47,Had a change of heart and want to be a tank.... at 40.,"My main is a Druid and I've been primarily healing up to this point. Recently I started really enjoying the feral perks of the Druid, and getting into using my bear form a lot more than I had been up to this point.

69,Server Choice for getting back into Classic WoW! More info below,"Greetings, travelers! 

I'm about to come back to WoW after a 7 years break, and never been so happy and looking forward to it!

I'm deciding on which server to embark on the adventure again, and these are my main parameters of decision:

\- Based in Italy (for server ping)

\- Normal or PvP server, not into RP

\- Main PvE focus (looking for an active community, I've read Ally in vanilla is better for PvE overall but I don't mind going Horde if the community is more engaged)

\- 2 hours/day playtime due to time constraints, can vary if raiding, but taking the game seriously with serious effort in whatever I'm doing

\- In the best case scenario, I'd level up, gear up and join a semi-casual raiding guild (1-2 nights / week)

Having said so, I looked up WoWHead Population Report for the player aggregated data, so I have an idea about the server populations and Ally to Horde ratios.

91,Why does gold feel so different now?,"Back in vanilla, I never had more than 2k gold to my name yet I always felt rich. I got my Ivory Raptor and easily bought any BoE that my class could benefit from, including dropping 900g on a Hand of Edward the Odd.

Yet one month into classic, I've already accumulated more wealth than I went through in all of vanilla. I haven't even gone out of my way to farm gold, I just play through the content normally and gold seems to roll in. Every time I clear my bags after a dungeon, I look at my gold and think ""well there's another easy 25g"". 

If I was making an effort to farm gold, then it would make sense that superior knowledge of farming methods would let me have more gold. But I am not making an attempt to farm. Gold just seems to roll in from normal gameplay.

The major mechanical difference *that is specific to gold* in classic is that experience completed from quests at max level is converted to gold already, whereas that change didn't happen in vanilla until later on. But there's gotta be some other factors besides that contributing to the inflation. What could they be?",1571182263.0,"Why does gold feel so different now?Back in vanilla, I never had more than 2k gold to my name yet I always felt rich.

92,"Help a retailer: Do healers and tanks heal and tank in their damage spec/gear while leveling, or how do they handle multiple specs in classic?","I'm used to the paradigm in retail, where changing spec is as easy as clicking a button and a lot of gear will change stats according to my spec. I'm a bit hesitant to roll a tank or healer in classic as i'm not exactly sure what is the expected behaviour in regards to specs, both while leveling and in end-game. Since changing spec is so expensive, i'm sure it cannot be expected for you to change specs often.

What is the usual thing to do, for a priest for instance? Is it feasible to spec shadow and heal as a shadow priest throughout leveling, or are you expected to go for a hybrid build if you want to do dungeons while leveling? What about paladins, where there's also Strength vs Intellect gear to think of? Should you manage two sets of gear in that case?

What about end-game, do you just go into holy/disc and then accept being inefficient at solo content?

128,PSA: Heal Yourself Between Pulls in Dungeons,"When you're in ""that"" group where there's just mass AoE DPS and the tank is using a 2H, everyone should be eating, drinking or bandaging in between pulls. 

It's extremely mana intensive for the healer who has to heal 4 characters (or 5 characters if you include a rowdy Hunter pet) as opposed to just 1 tank. 

If the healer has to drink after every pull and you're just standing there at 35% health waiting for the healer to heal you, you're the reason the dungeon is taking longer than it should. You're forcing the healer to drink twice, adding an extra 30 seconds between pulls. If there's no mage in the group you're also costing the healer money because they're burning through water. 30s per 5 level 45 water? That adds up quick.

Even worse the healer never gets full mana and when a patrol / adds show up into the mix, people start dieing. This creates stress on the healer which creates a toxic party and bad things get worse. I typically see this happen when the group is in a rush.

TL;DR: Heal yourself between pulls in dungeons. This means coming prepared with food and bandages.

165,Tanks at 60,"Hey all,

I recently hit 60 on a Druid and have been having a blast spamming dungeons and starting raiding, but there’s a huge issue I’ve noticed at 60, at least on my server/faction: Nobody wants to tank.

I know I know, we’ve heard it a million times, but I want to stress how odd the issue has been. Our guilds main tank stepped down to just be DPS/OT, and he doesn’t do any dungeons when he’s on anymore. The new warrior that joined our guild now just says “I’m DPSing” and leaves if you ask them to tank. /lfg is literally full of “LF Tank and g2g”.

Another way to put it in perspective, as a Druid my plan was to level as a tank and heal at 60. So 60 rolls around and I switch to NS/HOTW so I could tank or heal. Out of the probably 50ish end game dungeons I’ve done since 60, I actually healed 2 of them (UBRS is an exception, I usually heal that). And that was only because we found a new guildie that hasn’t started hating 60 tanking yet. They refuse to tank now btw.

So whats the problem? Why are so many people that initially wanting to tank ducking out? Well it’s been touched upon a lot here, but just to touch on it again....

1: Aggro gets annoying. With pugs 90% of the time you try to pull back someone attacks on the way there. People AOE nuke the second you pull. People decide to pull for you.

2: It gets tiring leading every group. No matter who puts the group together it can feel like babysitting. “Mage, don’t charge people for water. “ “No we aren’t adding on Baelgar to our Arena/Anger/Golem runs, it wasn’t advertised” “Hunter turn off pack” “Stop clicking things in Strat while in combat, everything here kills you” “Rogue stop facepulling” 

You need to know how to do every pull, the fastest way through the dungeon, etc. everyone else is just coasting on the tank.

3: The dungeons are actually rather difficult. Running with pugs gets scary. Last time you had a really good holy priest, but this time your healer is a “Resto Shaman” but a lot of their gear is Agility/Strength. Any of your pugs could have no idea how to do their role and the tank ends up responsible for how the pulls end up going.


Has everyone else had such a weird experience at 60 with every warrior stopping tanking altogether? For the tanks at 60, does constantly tanking wear on you? Or are you lavishing in immediate groups and feeling like a tank god?",1571173095.0,"Tanks at 60Hey all,

170,Undead Rogues: A tale,"How many of you remember decades-old YouTube videos by a guy named Gearbreaker? I found them hilarious, and in one of them he makes an off hand comment about all undeads being rogues and that’s always kinda stuck with me. 

One day I’m questing in STV. I come across a UD Rogue named “Stabinnu” and quickly made a snarky comment in guild chat about just how....lame that is. Hahaha UD Rogues are lame, whatever, moving on.

Next day, STV, I come across another UD Rogue named “Stabyoazz” and I’m like.....c’mon guys, can’t you do better? I make a snarky comment in guild chat again. 

But then.

Stabyoazz and I are outside the elite ogre cave, and apparently we’re on the same quest. I watch Stabyoazz take a stab at the elite ogre at the entrance, and being a nice guy, I help him out. Stabyoazz waves at me, thanks me, and then....proceeds deeper inside the cave, to the next elite ogre. He goes after him, and needing the quest myself and figuring what the hell, I go in and help. 

Stabyoazz thanks me again, but this time points at the next ogre, then at me, then stealths. He’s telling me something. So I go for the ogre by myself and he helps out. 

What followed after that was an epic exchange of teamwork. I point, he goes first. He points, I go first. We methodically work our way through the cave, using nothing but /point and /wait in case I need to slow his roll because I see a respawn or something. 

We get to the end, the quest mob is flanked by two body guards. This is gonna be tough. Stabyoazz points at one of the guards, points at me, I /nod, he stealths. He saps the other bodyguard and goes for the elite, tagging it first. But I’m not worried. We’ve been tag teaming this entire cave, surely he‘ll stick around and help me get my quest kill afterward. 

We didn’t get that far. The elite and single bodyguard proceed to wreck our faces off, we really didn’t have any business in the cave to begin with. 

By the time I get back to my corpse, Stabyoazz is gone, likely figuring the same. 

It was at that point I wanted to make a horde character and thank him for the good time, so I did and whispered him. He said he was literally about to do the same thing on my side! A good laugh and time was had by all.

175,TSM and the auction house..,"Hi,

TSM is making the auction house unplayable for users who do not have it and for users making human errors.

Backstory, I have added 3 100g items to auction overall and by what might be human error or lag on my auction posting, they have all been put in auction for 99 silver instead of 99 gold. On all occasions, I was sure i put the 98 in the gold section but this isn't where my problem is.

The problem is, that before these items have even loaded on my auctions list for me to see there is an issue and delete them, they have been sold. I have tried contacting those who bought it and after a long spam on of the people replied to me. They said they had TSM and would not send me the items back for the buy price after I told them it was a mistake and they were insta-bought.

Again, not my issue. The issue is the literal milliseconds it takes for this addon to spot an error that huge, and for other players to be taking advantage of this. Why, as a human with slower reaction times, am I competing against virtually bots who can make moves before I've even seen there is a problem?

It really isn't fun having to lose a lot of money that i've been farming for my mount for reasons that I can't even counter. I've lost 300 gold to situations where humans would not react so quickly. 

TSM should not be allowed in classic, it is absolutely unfair to play against. I understand it's a good addon, I understand people like it and I understand the initial problem is likely due to my error. HOWEVER, why why why do I not have enough time to even cancel these auctions or ACTUALLY SEE the error when it's loaded on my screen?

I've attached an image to show literally how fast my items were purchased.

https://imgur.com/a/Z4ZkXyV

I'm not sure what I can do about this, Blizzard told me that I should learn from the oopsie I did in the tickets. 

I do not want to play against this addon anymore, which people won't agree with but if you have any advice on what I can do to play against a botting addon.

Eddit:

Okay so I'm replying with the same thing over and over I might as well put it here. Yes, I can see its probably my fuck up. If you read closely, my problem isn't with my own mistakes. My problem is not having the milliseconds of time available to EVEN SEE OR CORRECT my human mistake because of an addon. An addon is a computer generated thing right? It's a bot that helps you. It gives you an insane advantage over someone else. The player who bought my items bought them without me even seeing my auction on my list, because it hadn't loaded. I couldn't even correct my error. THIS IS MY PROBLEM. This is what I don't like. Please do not misinterpret my statement as someone complaining they lost gold. It's fine, I understand my error.

181,Changing a quest-reward,"So I, like the idiot I am, accidentally picked the wrong reward for the quest where you turn in Onyxia's head. I wanted to get the necklace but picked the trinket.

After some googling I've found that some people through the years have had success in getting assistance from GM's with swapping quest-rewards. However it seems very fickle, and really down to the individual GM if they help you or not.

At some point in retail Blizzard made it policy to not help with changing quest-rewards and one of the main reasons being that you get the transmog's for all the different questrewards. That and the fact that there aren't really any quests in retail that reward end-game gear.

So after my first contact with a GM I was told that they could not replace my item because they want to stay as true to Vanilla WOW as possible. However I know that people have gotten help with this in the past so the answer doesn't quite satisfy me.

Does anyone here have any experience with this now in Classic?",1571166693.0,"Changing a quest-rewardSo I, like the idiot I am, accidentally picked the wrong reward for the quest where you turn in Onyxia's head. I wanted to get the necklace but picked the trinket.

After some googling I've found that some people through the years have had success in getting assistance from GM's with swapping quest-rewards. However it seems very fickle, and really down to the individual GM if they help you or not.

183,What to Do With a Good 2 Handed Weapon,"I was tempted to make this a Warrior question, but its a bit of a broader issue. Last night, I got OEB (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18822/obsidian-edged-blade), and while I was raiding as DW Fury, this weapon is leaps and bounds better than my 1Handers. This leaves me with 3 options:

1) Keep it as a pvp only weapon and continue DWing(No thanks, it looks awesome, I want to use it).
2) Use it as 2H fury.
3) Spec and raid as Arms.

Now, most people here might say ""Raid as arms? Heresy! You can't use up a debuff slot on garbage like Mortal Strike!"" I thought this was true, and resigned myself to 2H fury (which works, but does not make ideal use of the OEB, as you need considerable amounts of AP for BS to compare to MS. But I did some digging, and it seems that Mortal Strike is a medium priority debuff, and only competes with Corruption, Hemorrhage, Insect Swarm, and Moonfire for debuff slots. It does push off lower level debuffs, such as deep wounds, rupture, and garrote. In addition, for debuffs within the same category, DoT's push off non dots. That would mean that Mortal Strike is tied with Hemorrhage for the lowest of the medium priority debuffs, and the only debuffs that it would push off would be bleeds and serpent sting and such.

Also, I do know that DW fury will beat Arms in dps as gear improves, but I'm in a jumbled mix of pre-raid BiS blues and other blues, so I'm not there yet.

So my question to you fine ladies and gentleman, is this: Is it viable to raid as Arms, considering the above debuff priorities?",1571166327.0,"What to Do With a Good 2 Handed WeaponI was tempted to make this a Warrior question, but its a bit of a broader issue.

240,Thanks Reddit,"So let me begin, I play wow since vanilla and  I really played much of it - both pservers and retail. Whatever, for the last 2 years I quit wow and also did not turn on my computer (literally). 

I was aware of classic launch, but was sure that there is no way I am even trying this with my schedule. My friends invited me, they were so hyped, yet i did not even consider it.

3 days before classic launch I came to read in r/classicwow. I was scrolling down more and more reading different things... and here it is:
You guys made me realize that we all have a job and responsibilities now and that it is quite normal, considering that 15 years have passed. This really motivated me as most players in the game will be in similar situation and made me give it a chance. Did not take me long and I made my char at release date.

So yeah, to conclude this, yesterday I have reached level 60 on my healing priest, already  got eye of shadow, one piece t1, almost pre-raid bis, onyxia and mc attunaments. It was time efficient that I managed to get much stuff while leveling.

I feel like the pressure from the game is now over (like leveling makes you set targets, at least it made me). From now on I am comfortable that I am not way behind my friends, so I will not login in all my free time, but rather enjoy casually what the game has to offer.

Assuming you're playing the fitting race for your weapon, or wearing edgemaster you'll have 305+ Weaponskill, making the first 3% hit you normally need obsolete and therefor your yellow hits can't miss with 6% hit on your Gear:

If you have Heroic-Strike Queued up your Offhand gains the ""yellow-hit"" Multiplier. Therefor you're able to let your MH swing, queue HS till your OH swung, /stopcasting the Heroic strike to save rage (or let it go through if you're nearly ragecapped) and let your MH swing a white hit again. Making it impossible for your OH to miss = much better rage gen.

The same thing works with Cleave.

This is confirmed from Blizz to not be fixed, therefor ""bug-feature"".

Heres a useful Macro that makes your Heroic-Strike and Cleave toggleable:

""#showtooltip Heroic Strike

/startattack

/cast Heroic Strike

/stopcasting""

Replace ""Heroic Strike"" with ""Cleave"" for the Cleave macro.

256,AMIA For needing on a BoE epic shield I could not equip in a PUG group?,"I joined a PUG UBRS group that had no item reserves in place, with loot set to group loot.

I had just arrived in the dungeon, and helped kill the set of mobs when an epic shield dropped. Naturally everyone gasped and the tanks drooled. It was a BoE – which in my mind is fair game to *everyone* because that is the nature of PUG groups.

Now mind you, I am a warlock. I also have had a very difficult time gaining money in the game for various reason with a huge part of my money going into leveling tailoring. 

I announce to everyone, “All need” and a debate starts to happen, as two people have hastily greeded (which in my personal opinion, is your own fault, you should not just immediately greed and expect ninjas not to exist.) The two tanks and I debated as every single other person greeded, even though I repeatedly said we should all be needing on it, as it is fair game to all, and it is not fair for the tanks to claim is as their own simply because they can equip it. 

So guess who wins?

I’m on cloud nine. This is legitimately my *very* first REAL random epic. I have tier, but that does not count. During my time through wow vanilla, BC, and Wrath, I never saw an epic drop – let alone had a chance to roll of it. In classic I have now seen two, and won my second. However, this upset the tanks a lot, and people in the group was bashing on my decision to need. 

I asked if they wanted to me leave, or if I should stay, because this was getting very awkward, and sort of hostile. They said something like “Don’t you dare ninja that and then leave party.” And So I stayed.

I then proceed to get two random players messaging me not even in the group saying I’m a thief, that my reputation is going to be destroyed, that gold isn’t worth this. 

My heart is racing. I’m immediately anxious. I have already been repeatedly stating everyone should have needed. This was a bind on equip, not a bind on pick, and thus the nature of the beast is everyone needs on it IN A PUG GROUP – this was NOT  a guild run. This was NOT a item reserve run. This was a plain and simple “I’m a good luck charm today – wow look what dropped, all need, lets see who is lucky.”

One of the tanks /w me jokingly asking how much I’m asking for, to buy the shield from me. I express my actual feelings, how my heart is racing. How I feel awkward. How I was following protocol. How people have harassed me. That’s when I /ra and say, you two, reroll, now. They proceed to after a moment and one of the tanks wins the roll, and I pass it over to the player. 

I then said how everyone in the raid should have needed on that item, how no one had claim to it, regardless of its use to a player. The Bind on equip epic was absolutely fair game to every single player in the raid for UBRS because it was a pug.

I’m not ashamed to admit I /dnd and cried in my bed for about an hour. I thought I was going to be able to get back to the game, yet I couldn’t handle the pressure of logging in and having someone message me saying I’m some jerk because news didn’t spread that I gave the item up.

Am I the asshole?

Edit: I would like to take this moment to express that this is just a video game, and online harassment is real, and can have a real affect on people.

I have decidedly opted to say I am not the asshole. Regardless of the feelings of the midnight masses (I'm US.) I think that all BoE, Pattern, and other rare BoE items are fair game to all, and to claim that the tanks have priority is unfair because this was not a BiS Item, nor was it an item that could have been farmed for. I do not regret giving the tank the shield, however, I stand by my decision to have needed the shield in the first place. 

TLDR: I needed a BoE after warning everyone ""All need"" several times (before anyone needed) and one-by-one people greeded as I kept saying ""All need"".

The replacement shows up and the high dude is AFK. 5-10 minutes go by and they come back and say they passed out. Then the OTHER dps says one of their addons is glitched and they can't fix it and they need to mess around with settings for a minute. At this point it's been over an hour and a half inside and we were barely passed the first gate. Easily 2+ hours since I started putting together. The tank whispers me and says he's out and hearths. The DPS don't seem concerned whatsoever and just go oh well didn't work out let's find another tank. I had a little hope for a miracle so stayed for a bit but the LFG channel was full of LF tank spams so I gave up. Wasted 2.5 hours and got nothing done. And no one seemed to care about anyone's time.

How could I brighten my experience of playing the game? Should I do something specific to level faster? Sure there are online guides, but don't they kill the immersion in the world?

As I’ve been leveling my paladin I can say without a doubt collecting mp5 items like rings, necklaces, blessing of wisdom and nightfin soup made my gaming experience very enjoyable it felt just natural being able to complete rotations without having to worry about going oom 

Whether I was tanking Dungeons being able to easily hold agro using consecrate and retribution aura 

Solo grinding using seal of command and judgement of the crusader 

Or even healing.

I’m pretty determined to make mp5 my top priority because I feel it allows me to be truly versatile in regards to all specs. *well maybe not tanking*

Wanted input on this.",1571134583.0,"Investing into mp5 as a paladinHey guys so as a paladin I understand the requirement to heal in raids and dungeons so I created a build that well suits the needs

348,Onyxia tank guide,"There seem to be tons of misunderstandings about how Onyxia works at lvl 60after several testing runs with different amounts of tanks and different tank behavior in P1 we have reached the point where we understand how her agro system works.

5 base things

* the agro reset is a lie
* Fireballs reduce your agro, but this reduction can be resisted or avoided causing the next fireball to also hit you
* The fireballs hit the person on top of the agro list the moment she ends her previous cast
* Agro threshold of 110% is for targets that don't require moving, 130% is for targets that DO require moving.
* The knockback reduces your agro by a small percentage but can add up over the fight to make life hard for DPS without agro resets.

During P1 your treat list should look like this

* 100% Tank 1
* 85-90% DPS without agro resets
* 80-85% DPS with agro resets
* 80% Tank 2

At the start of P2 all DPS nukes like maniacs, trying to get above Tank1 in agro and making sure they eat at least 1 fireball during P2, after eating a fireball they make sure to reduce their DPS when getting close to Tank2's agro point.

DURING P2 the agro list should look like this

* 130% mages/warlocks before fireball
* 120% warriors that did not take a fireball
* 100% Target of the current fireball
* 95% Rogues/Hunters
* 80% Tank 1
* 75% tank 2
* 65-70% mages/warlocks that did take a fireball
* 55-60% warriors that did take a fireball

At the end of P2, the agro table should be like this

* 100% target of the current fireball
* 90-95% hunters/rogues
* 80% Tank1
* 76-79% mages/warlocks
* 75% tank 2
* 60% warrior DPS

Any DPS with agro reset uses their agro reset the moment she announces her landing making sure they are under Tank2 in agro. At the start of P3 all DPS without resets who are still above Tank1 (or above Tank2 in case Tank1 took a fireball hit) have to prepare to be the target of Onyxia, by moving away from her towards the tank side of the cave they can ensure a 130% agro point is required to agro the boss.

This should result in a P3 agro table looking like this, after all vanish/feign death action

* 110% mages/warlocks that are not in range of onyxia
* !00% tank1
* 90% tank2
* 80-85% melee DPS
* 30% healers
* 0% hunters/rogues

If your agro table is like this, a mere 10-second reduction in DPS for melee to ensure the tank can get her into position is sufficient to never lose agro on the tank.Tthat should ensure a nice transition into P3

If done properly she can be solo tanked with this tactic but it's not suggested.only using white hits in P1 results in the tanks both taking a fireball, reducing their agro. Any mage/lock that pulls out their can of whoop-ass will be above the tanks on the agro table by the time she lands",1571129397.0,"Onyxia tank guideThere seem to be tons of misunderstandings about how Onyxia works at lvl 60after several testing runs with different amounts of tanks and different tank behavior in P1 we have reached the point where we understand how her agro system works.

367,Mount/riding price and future patch question.,"Hey there user of reddit, first post over here. 
I have some doubts over the mount and riding system for classic, and the upcomings patchs and updates.
As far as I find over forums and archives, it seems that the system:

80g for slow mount and 900g fast mount, BoU (bind on use) needing the acording skill, buyable by anyone and tradeable.
20g for riding slow and 100g for riding fast, per race, needing the rep to learn.
(All that without discount)
But I learn that in upcoming patch it will change to:
General riding (aprentice) slow at 100g, for every race mount included. And general (journeyman) fast at 1000g, for every race mount included.
1g for slow mounts, and 10g for fast mount, but needing the rep to buy, and BoP (bind in pickup) untradeable.
(All that too, without discounts)

Soooo:
-What happend if before the patch I have bought other race mounts? Will I be able to use them, since I have the general riding skill, and alredy have them, without the rep?
-What happend to people that has learned more that 1 riding?
-Will I have the general riding if I learned just my race? (Saving a bunch of money)
-Can I buy just 1 riding at 60 for 100g, and wait to patch to buy the mount for 10g, to save a lot?

First we go back to the very beginning.  In 2004 and early 2005 (EU) the game was launched and not many people chose enchanting as their profession. It had a negative reputation. You had to DESTROY items to get going. DESTROY!  We were just so happy we got anything. Why would you want to Destroy that?  So it was Expensive and Mysterious. And the rewards were not very clear.  And on top of that it was (looked) Random (the materials gained  from disenchanting.)  

It was mostly popular because you could a nice glow on your weapon.  So everybody ran around with a cheap beast slaying enchant or whatever it was that caused a glow.

_________________________________

A few months later, a few patches later, a few raids later.  The hardcore players started to notice that the end game enchants were very good.  Every guild got at least one guild enchanter and important guild members got their enchants, if needed with financial aid from the guild.   But still not many people had enchanting.   And few people knew how it worked.
 
So now it's the end of 2005. We are busy in MC and BWL and life is good. Some of us discover that you can disenchant anything at lvl 5.  And with thottbot  patterns emerge... Oh so this and that item always disenchants into X or Y dream dust or lesser eternal essences?  Excel sheets are made and the algorithm is discovered.  Still this information is not wide spread.  

------------------------------------------------------------

Back in the day (2006) I made tons of money with disenchanting. Most people had no clue, so you could pick up cheap stuff to disenchant night and day.  Some leatherworker would powerlevel his craft and sell all of the stuff just above vendor price. let's say the vendor gave 35s for an item, he was happy to get 45s..  I would buy all 14 of them and disenchant them for an EV of 75s.  30s profit an item.  And the next day some other guy would do the same, day after day.  Basically you were only limited by bag space.   You made 250g a month just by standing next to the mailbox.


-------------------------------------------------------


Around 2013 I played pservers and it still was ok, although you noticed a trend: people got more knowledgeable. 

Now in 2019 it's a disaster. (Almost) everybody knows everything and has addons and if an item's expected value to disenchant is 87s you can bet 100g that you will (almost) never find it for sale for less than 80s. And most are 90s or more. 

The profit margins are so slim that it takes a lot of transactions to make a little profit . not worth your time, unless it's the only thing you do in game.

So the only thing left to do is, combine it with tailoring or leatherworking and make whatever item is profitable yourself usually wicked leather stuff or runed headbands  cloth stuff.  But this is hard work and time consuming. Your profit / hour is lower. 

Or get it to 300 with access to raid enchants, but that means you have to stand hours on the IF bridge to establish your Enchanting Emporium, get customers and build a name. I play this game to become a soldier, not a market vendor who has to shout all night to sell 2 crusader enchants. 

The golden days of disenchanting are over.  And that is fine.  We can find new ways to earn our gold.

The golden days of disenchanting are over.  And that is fine.  We can find new ways to earn our gold.   And we have the memories.",0

So I have been unable to get some good + % hit gear, only Rune of the Guard Captain. I am wondering which weapon I should be using in main hand and which weapon for off hand.

Since I have axe specialization as Orc it should make me more likely to hit with Dawns Edge, so on main hand I might be more likely to land white hits as well as abilities. But, Thrash Blade is probably better as a main hand in every other aspect.

Any thoughts?

Maybe Dawns Edge wasn't the best thing to craft but I haven't been able to get Tooth of Eranikus after many tries so I gave up. I wanted an axe and I wanted more chance to hit.

&#x200B;

Today is a bright day, for I, on my character Ironphelecar, Dwarf Rogue on the Mirage Raceway server, have cleared the game in Iron Man !

I have provided aid to all the people in my home town of Dun Morogh and my Human allies in Elwynn Forest, cleared the once-fertile lands of Westfall, freed the dead from their curse in Duskwood and Wetlands, braved the deepest forest, the wildest animals of Stranglethorn Vale, survived the harmful climate and centaurs of Desolace, assisted the Night Elves in the luxurious forest of Feralas, met the proud Dwarves of the Wildhammer Clan in The Hinterlands, ended a bandit organisation in Tanaris to protect the inhabitants of Gadjetzan, waged war with the rival Iron Dwarf clan in the Searing Gorge and finally faced the fearsome dinausors of Un'Goro Crater.

I did as many quests as I possibly could in all those areas, and grinded everything else.

After 11 days, 4 hours and 45 minutes of questing and murdering thousands of crabs, gorillas, blood elves and a few others, bringing them close to extinction, I have finally reached level 60 using only the bare minimum.

I lost and deleted a total of 25 characters in the process, 4 of them being above level 20 (including one which was level 42).

&#x200B;

To talk about my previous experience with World of Warcraft, I have never played Vanilla, and I did not play it on private servers either. I started at BC and played one month, came back to WOTLK and played about two months, then about 6 (or a bitr more) during Cataclysm, and finally a month in legion and about 3/4 months in BFA. Totals a bit more than a year total since BC (not counting Classic).

501,"As someone who main-tanked in Vanilla (BRD), TBC (up to Karazhan), WOTLK (25-man Naxx and ICC), and the first raids of Cata, I just wanted to say this about tanking: It really isn't that hard.","I'm getting kinda sick of these whiny tank posts. The actual act of Classic tanking isn't that hard. 

You can auto-pilot if you or your group isn't in a hurry. You can lose aggro on 1-2 mobs and not instantly kill someone else (this changes in later expansions). You can completely ignore those mobs too, most of the time, unless they're hurting your bae (healer). You can screw up and the rest of the group can fix it. And you have the privilege of walking into any dungeon you want in 15 minutes or less.

The actual act of tanking isn't very hard, but the preparation is:

- You can't coast through it with old gear or DPS greens. You're spending a lot of time and gold finding upgrades. It's very gear dependent, and because of that, I didn't have enough for my mount until I was 45. But you know what, I was very lucky with some BOE epics later (from tanking so much) and it all paid for my epic mount.

- You have a hard time with new dungeons you haven't been in before, so you try to research the map, which really doesn't teach you about which packs to pull and what they do. For that, you ask for help and someone else to guide you. I recommend asking someone to skull packs for you to pull. Think of yourself as a smart missile, and they are ""painting your target"".

- There are many cool tanking abilities that you want to add to your skill set and use on rotation, but figuring out how can be tough. I have a lot of Shield Block (always, always keep this active) and Heroic Strike (rage dump) macros. You should google them. (By the way, I've about given up on a good Cleave macro for tanking. I simply don't have the rage to spend on that one.)

- Your solo damage really suffers from tank talents, and you start to question if it's worth it. Well guess what, it is. You've probably obtained much more offspec gear at half the time than a DPS took to sit and wait in groups for you to come along. The only downside I can think of to Prot talents is that it probably took you much longer to solo level. If you're at 60, you have nothing to whine about.

I think what's burning all of you is the amount of time you put into your art, and when others make mistakes or do things half-assed, it insults how much effort you put. I understand, but you know what, it's just a game. And you're also super privileged to be able to drop a bad group and walk into a new group pretty quick.

What i am trying to figure out is optimal spec/build to use until gear improves.

Conventional wisdom is a dual wield 1h with a 17/34/0 build. My concern there is my gearing. My 1h weapons (swords) are not good right now.  Basically a Thrash Blade and a 35 dps quest green (2.4 attack time, +22 AP), but the 5 weaponskill for being human i know matters a bit on raid bosses.

Without test dummies it is hard to say what the better option is and ive ran it through a few spreadsheets and i still am not sure which way to go.

(You'd be surprised),"Blizzard used to have a very specific Terms of Service for WoW, around 2014 or 2016 they got rid of it and made a broad EULA that applies to all their games.  Most of the naming rules still apply today, however, given the games size they are only enforced upon a player reporting the name.  ^((So if you wanted to troll you can get almost any player on your server to have a forced name change with a simple right click report))

&#x200B;

Here are the Terms from 2004/06 regarding naming. I feel like 95% of the players I've encountered, including myself would require a name change haha.  I enjoyed the example names from 2006 ToS. I remember seeing so many players with Xbox in their name back then lmao.

[Specifics on Naming Policy form 2004 ToS](https://web.archive.org/web/20040603074143/http://worldofwarcraft.com/termsofuse.shtml)

**a. Rules Related to User Names.** Each user will select a name for his or her character, or allow the World of Warcraft software to select the name for him or her. Additionally, users may form ""guilds"" and such guilds will be required to choose a name for the guild. When you choose a screen name, create a guild, or otherwise create a label that can be seen by other players of World of Warcraft, you must abide by the rules of common decency. If Blizzard, in its sole discretion, finds such a label to be offensive, it reserves the right to change the name, remove the label and corresponding chat room, and/or suspend your use of World of Warcraft.

In particular, you may **not** use:

1. Names of another person with the intent to impersonate that person;
2. Names which incorporate 'swear' words or which are otherwise offensive, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable;
3. Names subject to the rights of any other person without authorization;
4. Names of popular culture or media personalities;
5. Names that are trademarks, or registered trademarks **(e.g., Ferrari, Zenith, Pepsi, Charmin);**
6. Names of religious individuals; **(e.g., Buddha, Jesus, Allah, Jehovah, Lucifer);**
7. Names of characters from Blizzard's Warcraft products, including character names from the Warcraft series of novels; or
8. Names related to drugs, narcotics, or criminal activity, including references to drug substances (e.g., Heroin, Cocaine, Cannibus).

Additionally, you may not purposely use a misspelling or an alternative spelling to circumvent the name restrictions listed above, nor can you have a ""first"" and ""last"" name that, when combined, violate the above name restrictions.

*Rules Related to Usernames and Guild Designations.*

Each user will either select a character name or allow the Program to automatically select a character name at random. Additionally, users may form ""guilds"" and such guilds will be required to choose a name for the guild. When you choose a character name, create a guild, or otherwise create a label that can be seen by other players using the Program, you must abide by the following guidelines as well as the rules of common decency. If Blizzard finds such a label to be offensive or improper, it may, in its sole and absolute discretion, change the name, remove the label and corresponding chat room, and/or suspend or terminate your use of the Program.

In particular, you may not use any name:

1. Belonging to another person with the intent to impersonate that person, including without limitation a ""Game Master"" or any other employee or agent of Blizzard;
2. That incorporates vulgar language or which are otherwise offensive, defamatory, obscene, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable;
3. Subject to the rights of any other person or entity without written authorization from that person or entity;
4. That belongs to a popular culture figure, celebrity, or media personality;
5. That is, contains, or is substantially similar to a trademark or service mark, whether registered or not;
6. Belonging to any religious figure or deity;
7. Taken from Blizzard's Warcraft products, including character names from the Warcraft series of novels;
8. Related to drugs, sex, alcohol, or criminal activity;

Asmongold was recently reported for the name Krackmonkey (Clearly in violation of the above rules). He tried to argue that it wasn't, they told him it is and he must change his name or face a suspension.

Well he pulled a power move on Blizzard, and renamed his character FreeHongKong, an obvious violation of the ToS, but given current events if Blizzard suspended him the media would report it as ""Blizzard bans streamer over Free Hong Kong name"" which would be a PR nightmare for them.",1571106134.0,"How many of your/(people you know) names are in Violation of ToS. (You'd be surprised)Blizzard used to have a very specific Terms of Service for WoW, around 2014 or 2016 they got rid of it and made a broad EULA that applies to all their games.  Most of the naming rules still apply today, however, given the games size they are only enforced upon a player reporting the name.  ^((So if you wanted to troll you can get almost any player on your server to have a forced name change with a simple right click report))

&#x200B;

Here are the Terms from 2004/06 regarding naming. I feel like 95% of the players I've encountered, including myself would require a name change haha.  I enjoyed the example names from 2006 ToS. I remember seeing so many players with Xbox in their name back then lmao.

[Specifics on Naming Policy form 2004 ToS](https://web.archive.org/web/20040603074143/http://worldofwarcraft.com/termsofuse.shtml)

**a. Rules Related to User Names.** Each user will select a name for his or her character, or allow the World of Warcraft software to select the name for him or her. Additionally, users may form ""guilds"" and such guilds will be required to choose a name for the guild. When you choose a screen name, create a guild, or otherwise create a label that can be seen by other players of World of Warcraft, you must abide by the rules of common decency. If Blizzard, in its sole discretion, finds such a label to be offensive, it reserves the right to change the name, remove the label and corresponding chat room, and/or suspend your use of World of Warcraft.

In particular, you may **not** use:

1. Names of another person with the intent to impersonate that person;
2. Names which incorporate 'swear' words or which are otherwise offensive, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable;
3. Names subject to the rights of any other person without authorization;
4. Names of popular culture or media personalities;
5. Names that are trademarks, or registered trademarks **(e.g., Ferrari, Zenith, Pepsi, Charmin);**
6. Names of religious individuals; **(e.g., Buddha, Jesus, Allah, Jehovah, Lucifer);**
7. Names of characters from Blizzard's Warcraft products, including character names from the Warcraft series of novels; or
8. Names related to drugs, narcotics, or criminal activity, including references to drug substances (e.g., Heroin, Cocaine, Cannibus).

Additionally, you may not purposely use a misspelling or an alternative spelling to circumvent the name restrictions listed above, nor can you have a ""first"" and ""last"" name that, when combined, violate the above name restrictions.

*Rules Related to Usernames and Guild Designations.*

Each user will either select a character name or allow the Program to automatically select a character name at random. Additionally, users may form ""guilds"" and such guilds will be required to choose a name for the guild. When you choose a character name, create a guild, or otherwise create a label that can be seen by other players using the Program, you must abide by the following guidelines as well as the rules of common decency. If Blizzard finds such a label to be offensive or improper, it may, in its sole and absolute discretion, change the name, remove the label and corresponding chat room, and/or suspend or terminate your use of the Program.

In particular, you may not use any name:

1. Belonging to another person with the intent to impersonate that person, including without limitation a ""Game Master"" or any other employee or agent of Blizzard;
2. That incorporates vulgar language or which are otherwise offensive, defamatory, obscene, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable;
3. Subject to the rights of any other person or entity without written authorization from that person or entity;
4. That belongs to a popular culture figure, celebrity, or media personality;
5. That is, contains, or is substantially similar to a trademark or service mark, whether registered or not;
6. Belonging to any religious figure or deity;
7. Taken from Blizzard's Warcraft products, including character names from the Warcraft series of novels;
8. Related to drugs, sex, alcohol, or criminal activity;

10. Comprised of gibberish (**e.g., ""Asdfasdf"", ""Jjxccm"", ""Hvlldrm"");**

529,Solo tribute runs,"Hey all,

So I’m sure most of us have heard of Hunters soloing Tribute runs to make insane gold per hour. But what other classes can solo the run?

From my understanding, Mind Control is working differently than PServers as it puts you in combat in Classic, so I don’t think a Priest could get past the last guard (Maybe I just don’t understand their version of the run).

For Druid I’ve seen PServer videos of Druids just kiting for a long time and leaving up moonfire and insect swarm and kiting until an eventual boss kill which I am going to attempt, but obviously this is a Private Server and any number of things could be wrong about that video.

I’m not even sure rogues/Druids are able to stealth past the last guard like they do on PServers, but worst comes to worst could grab a rogue and Duo it by having the rogue run past the final guard and vanish once I’m past.

Does anyone have insight on classes being able to solo/duo tribute aside from Hunter?

530,Using Your Mailbox as a Bank,"I thought this was pretty common knowledge, but I've been speaking with a bunch of folks who didnt realize this was possible/feasible....

With bank space being limited in Classic, many of us (rightfully) turn to bank alts to store our wares as we are out questing and ganking lowbies.  However, the bank alt does have one noticable disadvanatge: mail delay.  If you need some pots for raid night, for example, and your bank alt was holding them for you, you are SOL for an hour, unless you can trust someone to trade them for you.

The alternative that you may find useful if using your mailbox as a pseudo-bank.  The method is simple:

1) Load up a mail message with a bunch of items

2) Send them to an alt

3) Wait an hour

4) Check your alt's mailbox and click ""Return"" to send the message back to your main

5)~~An hour later~~....Profit (thanks to u/WWYOG for the clarification)

Now you have up to 12 items sitting in your mailbox for 30 days, for a low cost of a couple silver.  And hey, if you forgot to loot them before the 30 day limit is up, no big deal, they get sent back to your alt.

From what I understand, the mailbox unique mail limit is 100, so using this method, you can potentially store up to *1200* unique stacks of items in your mailbox.

548,Existential Crisis as a Pally,"Hey guys, to preface I'm loving classic so far, been levelling a 31 pally and recently started a 12 mage.

Having a bit of a crisis now considering I've sunk over 3 days time played into my pally and levelling is fairly slow compared to my mage. I love dungeons but doing gnomeregan over and over is repetitive. I've also heard that pally tanks don't do too well endgame so I'm wondering if I should delete my pally and main my mage at this point. I played quite a few years ago during cataclysm and pally were OP, but now its somewhat troublesome to hold aggro in dungeons and I kill each mob during quests in 30+secs due to a low variety of attacks.

Just need some guidance on what to do with this pally, he's specced 11 points in holy to get conc and the rest in protection. I've also heard that some pally characters respec endgame? How hard/long is this? Is this the right path?

557,Reasons why there are a lack of Tanks..among other things.,"Reddit, Streamers, and by extension, the community parroting them told them that Warriors are the only viable Tanks.

They also told them that Warrior is also the best DPS in the game. (This is why you may have a party with 2 warriors and no tank.)

This is also why, (before blizzard broke census addons) out of 26k scans on my server, 20% of the server was Warriors (offset by bank alts) and 16% was Mages.

 Reddit, the Streamers, and the community parroting them, told them Mages and Warriors were the best at everything so now they're everywhere. Warriors who only want to dps and Mages spamming for ""spellcleave"" and aoeing single targets in dungeons.

If Feral Druids, Enhancement Shamans, and Ret Paladins can put on Int gear and heal, Warriors can put on a shield and tank.

Reddit, Streamers, and the community parroting them, told them that everything that wasn't a Warrior, Rogue, Mage, or Priest, was a ""meme"" spec. Which is arguably worse than calling them ""Less Viable"" as being a ""meme spec"" has now become synonymous with being ""useless"" in the communities eyes.

Hunters were told that they ..""dont scale into Naxx"" so they're apparently a bad class because they dont scale into the very last phase and raid of the game.

This was also said about Warlocks with the community claiming ""Warlocks arent good until Naxx.""

Everything that is accomplished by anything that isnt a Warrior, Rogue, Mage, or Priest is heavily downplayed. - A Feral Druid tanked a majority of MC several weeks back and was bashed on by the community simply because ""warriors are better"" and that it's a waste of time to use anything else.

The community parrots the only reason Druids exist is to Innervate the Priest or Brez a Tank. This is why for 3 weeks straight I've yet to see more than 1 or 2 Druids in a 40 man Ony or MC raid.

The community parrots that Holy Paladins, Resto Druids, and Resto Shamans are weaker and less viable healers than Priests, despite the strengths and utilities every other healer brings into a group in both PvE and PvP. HoTs, Brez, innervate, totems, buffs, aoe heals and strong single target heals. All of these get overlooked because Dwarf Priests get Fear Ward?

As classic has gone on the message has become skewed like in a game of telephone. The message used to be ""Priests are very good"" in pve and pvp and now has become ""Priest are the best"".

I cant speak for the Alliance, but from a Horde perspective I've seen far more Dwarf Priests than Paladins of any race on my server and I have a feeling as to why.

There is a big divide of people who think Feral Tanks are viable in dungeons and those who believe they're also a Meme spec because the reputation Boomkins and Feral dps have. Telling people Feral druids are bad, telling them if they want to be viable as a tank or dps that they need to farm gnomer maces till the end of time.. but also telling them that theyll only be viable as a healer while also telling them that they're also the most boring healer in the game hasnt helped their already historically low play rate.

As I am Horde, I dont have the luxury of playing with Prot Paladins however I do know that they arent well received by the community for their lack of snap aggro and mana costs. However having played a Prot paladin in vanilla their aoe threat is fantastic in dungeons. Competing for a raid slot as prot is up to the guild to decide.

The community has a really awful habit of saying too many different things as facts. They've discarded almost half the playable classes as ""useless"" or ""memes"" with a few lucky ones having the luxury of being considered ""less viable"" under certain conditions.

When you tell people everything but 4 classes are good, nobody is going to want to play anything else. There are a lot of uninformed players taking advice from people who dont know any better themselves and this is how you end up with servers that are a majority of warriors who wont tank despite being told they're the best tanks, mages who dont know how to be in a regular party, raids with no druids, a lack of tanks in general, and an over abundance of Rogues Priests and Mages.

The reasons there are a lack of tanks isnt because Druids and Paladins arent viable, it's because you told them they're useless.

Today i want to post stats of the famous sword, that 95-98% of warriors and rogues was using, if not using it right now since they ran Maraudon instance. The name of it is: [Thrash Blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17705/thrash-blade) .

It is quest reward for [Corruption of Earth and Seed](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=7065/corruption-of-earth-and-seed) (it have both Alliance and Horde versions);

&#x200B;

[Arms tanking spec, yep, im retarded a bit...](https://i.redd.it/fb87onywyis31.png)

My overview:

I guess i don't need to say why this blade is Pre-Raid BiS for warrior in both Prot and Fury tree's, and a pretty good off-hand for a combat rogues. Even without direct counting player who handles it get's that it proc's pretty often. But the usefullness of this swords ends where the numbers begin. As we have chance of proc we can count true DPS of the sword, and the result is not good enough: 35.2 x 1.04 (\~4% proc) = 36.6 DPS . Some of rogues can argue, that this sword is slow, since it have better proc chance for enchantments, and type of proc gives another attack. For what i can say that 4% of second attack gives 4% outgoing dps, and only 4%, as second attack have its own chance to proc the enchantment/poison, and if we need to count total DPS of the sword we can compare its version with proc WITH the same sword without proc. Just imagine it. The Rogue A, that have 1 Thrash Blade(without proc) beats Manequin for 100 damage each attack, gives it 100 attacks, dealing 10k dmg (100\^2), against the Rogue B, that have 1 Thrash Blade (with proc) for the same time beats another Manequin, but (100% / 4% = 25(avg hits for proc)) thus dealing 10.4k dmg for the same time. DPS is the same. And with applied poisons, that, for example, proc with 25% chance, it will deal same amount of different damage, in percentage. It will always be 100% against 104%...

I hope i didn't confused you much, as i need to proceed. Even with all this math i guess not everyone got my thoughts, so i will tell you it's advantages and downsides:

\+ Warrior's with talent ""Deep Wounds"" will proc it a bit often while wearing Thrash Blade(your group members may ask you for your mental health if they see you proccing that talent with DW spec);

\- Rogue's poisons die away a bit faster than with weapon of same Attack Speed (further ""AS"");

\~ Talent's such as ""Sword Specialization"", that gives you extra attack, can trigger with this sword, they trigger off of attack of this sword (giving you 4 random numbers while u wearing Hand of Justice), and, i guess, theoritically you can reach that moment when you procced like 6-9 attacks off of the single one (as all counted won't proc off itself, but may proc off the similar effect (Sword Specialization => HoJ => Thrash Blade => HoJ => Thrash Blade(again, in theory, chance is rly low))

BUT STILL, such talents as mentioned before, only gives you percent of DPS, not flat one (which is much better);

\- Warrior's Enrage (12 attacks with increased damage) and Flurry (3 attacks with increased attack speed) proc's more often, but also end a bit faster, thus, again, not providing much extra DPS, other than just 4%;

&#x200B;

Overall:

Thus, Thrash Blade is really good while you playing solo, won't hide - it fills you with feel of reward, when it procs, as 25th hit is still feels like advantage (even if you know that it's not)

But anyway, because of lack of good weapons for combat rogues and fury warriors(and prot warriors(and prot paladins)) i still advice to use this one. Thrash Blade is good sword for leveling as it provides more DPS than other weapons.

But when the endgame starts, and it always starts with BRD/LBRS - you may store your Thrash Blade in bank for memories of good times, when you thought you was much stronger than mobs (but it was just 4% better than the same sword stats without proc).

I want to be honest, i thought it gives much DPS boost too, but it doesn't. Doesn't at all. Math ruins everything.

620,DPS shadow priest numbers question.,"Okay, so I ran SM:Lib on Saturday and one of the toons had a dps meter that showed our total damage for the run. I played with 2 warriors, and 2 druids.

How the heck is there that big of a gap? I went in at lvl 32. Everyone was near the same level, within one or two.

629,The slow and insidious death of an amazing guild. How does my story compare to your own?,"Edit: Wow. Thank you to everyone that shared their similar experience. I'm not glad that it happened to you all, but found some solace in knowing there were similarities.

Making this post for 2 reasons:

1. To share the story of the death of my guild and see if any of it mirrors the experience of any of you guys
2. To check this post after phase 6 to see if history repeats itself in classic wow, and this happens to most other guilds.

I was in the best guild on my server. We were 3rd (i think) in the U.S. to open AQ gates. Overall I wouldn't say top 10 US, but def top 25 when considering all of vanilla progression.

I joined after they had cleared most of MC. I was in a casual guild before that with RL friends, but decided I wanted to raid and raid seriously.  Originally they planned to have 2 teams for MC. Both clearing to Rag. We kept that up for less than a month and then basically took the best of both teams and made it our main raid force. I was thrilled to be included in that.

During MC, people were happy to be on. Happy to help each other. Very few fights. Maybe someone would get everyone blown up and people would be angry, but overall everyone excited to log in and raid. When we weren't raiding, all of us were running dungeons with each other, or farming firewater together, or leveling alts.

BGs - I may have this out of order, but when they came out, we were excited to run them with guildmates. We made groups of guildies and had a blast.  We ran versus the second best guild on server (other faction) and boy was that fun. They were very skilled.

BWL.  We loved it. I mean it. The entire guild. With no strats really out there, each fight was a challenge.  As the weeks went on, some parts were quite boring and you could tell at least at this part people were starting to phone it in (the snare traps for sure).  But we kept on. There were some roadblocks, but progression continued.

Nefarion. My goodness. No strats out there like every other fight, but was there some method to the madness of all these spawns?  Guilds that had already beat it for good reason wanted to keep it to themselves.  I remember all the crazy and intricate theories people had for what it was that spawned him.  I also remember when finding out it was 42 and a dumb hitchhiker's guide reference, myself and my guild wanted to punch someone in the face at blizzard. Maybe we were also angry with ourselves for overlooking such a simple thing. Kill 42.

Nef dies. The second best guild on the server (other faction) even congratulates us. That legitimately felt great. But I would be lying if it wasn't the apex of our guild's fun/progression/stability.

Leadup to AQ. We start to see some major players in each class log in less and less. But, hey, AQ is out. We gotta open the gates. No sleep. Teams of people working on different resources. Some for cloth. People standing at spawn points for certain herbs.  I was made the liaison to the (other faction) guild so we could help them get mats their side needed, and they could do the same for us.  Probably the only fond memory of this period was how they were our competition up until this point but we set aside our differences and made our server one of the first to open AQ.

Not long into AQ. Guild chat isn't so much quieter, but it's just instructions, admonishing, complaining. No one is laughing anymore in ventrilo.  More names of core members sparsely logging in. We had some of the best mages in pvp, and we can't even get more than 1 mage for this stupid fight and we need frostbolt. Also this princess fight sucks so much I play an alt healer to help us get through. The armor from here looks horrible. The bugs are not fun. Longest corpse runs in the history of gaming it seems. Everything here is stupid. My brother quits. I think about it seriously for the first time too. No one groups anymore. No one does BGs together anymore.

Naxx. Man this will be different. Won't it? I mean the aesthetic to this place is so cool. I have to take a different shift at work so there is one or sometimes two raid nights I cant make for the next 2 or 3 months. Its ok. We raid 5, sometimes 6 days a week. (laughable to think about that now).  We killed anub, and the mage girl. The guy who splits raid in half with a wall.   This zone is not messing around. A mistake means a wipe in so many fights. A wipe means clearing all this trash all over again. How long can you go without messing up once? 5 or 6 days, hours and hours a day, no one is perfect. Right?

Now when I log in and say hello, I am greeted by names I don't recognize.  Raid starts in 15 minutes. Normally people would be dueling outside. Laughing in vent. There is none of that.  Almost no one is here. Most people get here right as we are about to start. I don't blame them.  I make a mistake and am called out by someone who I never spoke to before. I didn't know they were in the guild till today. It's like that scene from Band of Brothers where they take their frustrations out on the replacements because all their original members are gone. This guy wasn't even mean, but I am mad anyways.  This guild is not what it used to be.

Weeks go by. In a desperate plea to try to get us more focused they start imposing penalties on messing up. Die to a blob? Farm mats for guild. Miss thaddeus jump? Farm mats.  Go negative position instead of positive on thad? Farm mats.

This proves to be the fatal blow.  People make mistakes, as humans tend to do. We are hemorrhaging members. This isn't fun anymore. This feels like punishment. Not just farming mats, but the actual zone feels like it was designed to be punitive. Like it was made to make people who play games and laugh together, yell at each other, blame each other. I start to look forward to when we wipe, because then I can go outside, clear my head, grab a smoke, and not be there. I realize this is happening and post on our guild forum that I am quitting. Oh look at that, a priest who was in our guild since MC has posted their goodbye too before I even got the chance to hit post.

I stay in touch with a few friends, but overall it never gets better. They may have done four horseman but I honestly couldn't tell you for sure. The guild eventually reforms under just a few, under a different name, in a different expansion.

&#x200B;

So that's it guys. For anyone who made it through, that may have seemed super emo, but I was wondering if that was unique to my guild or if anyone else had similar experiences?

I also want to check to see if people experience a similar sequence of events in classic, or if due to all the knowledge out there, it will be different?

Final edit: Just read this again, and while this may seem depressing, this is just how the guild fell apart. Throughout this entire experience, there are countless pages that could be written about hilarious, fun, exciting, and overall great times.  I think the reason most of us are playing classic again is to recapture some of those moments. And so far classic has been a blast!",1571093697.0,"The slow and insidious death of an amazing guild.

635,Solution to your Onyxia threat issues,"On the front end I want to acknowledge I have no idea if this is working as intended, but I saw this recommended in a comment awhile back and I continue to see people mentioning their tanks have a hard time picking up Onyxia in P3 while basically nobody recommends this strategy. 

Obviously a lot of people feel the threat mechanics on that fight are unclear, but the general consensus is that fireballs in P2 have some type of threat reduction and that those highest on her threat table in P1 are usually the first ones targeted. This means that your MT and the next 5-7 total targets are going to have their aggro reduced and be starting basically from zero threat P3. This usually translates into RIP warlocks, mages, and often some healers while you hope your raid doesn’t get annihilated by a breath.

**The solution**

Have your OT be #2 threat at the end of P1, then have your MT and OT stack during P2 and everyone else stay clear. For whatever reason it seems that if someone that is not primary threat from P1 gets hit by a fireball when someone else is on top of them, their threat is not reduced. This means when Onyxia lands in P3 she will usually go directly to your OT.

I tested this multiple times this weekend with my guild and every time this is how it played out:

1. Onyxia fireballs me (MT). For whatever reason even if me and OT were stacked, she would still only target me once.

2. Onyxia fireballs 1-2 other random targets.

3. Onyxia fireballs OT (we are stacked) and she continues to fireball him for the remainder of P2. Obviously this means you have two targets taking a decent bit of damage, but our healers knew we would be the only targets and could plan accordingly. Also this meant the rest of the raid didn’t have to worry about splashing each other.

4. Onyxia lands in P3, OT is her first target while the raid gets in position. It is important to note that if he eats a knock back immediately there is still a chance it may end up on someone else, but his chances of getting her back quickly are much higher. 

Every attempt we had that same progression, which meant we usually didn’t lose a single person in the transition into P3. We’d give the OT some time to position and build threat, other tanks would build threat, and then you slow burn her down with everyone up.

Hopefully this helps some of you ease your frustrations with this boss. It very well may be a bug, but it certainly helped us. Let me know if if you have tried this as well!",1571092744.0,"Solution to your Onyxia threat issuesOn the front end I want to acknowledge I have no idea if this is working as intended, but I saw this recommended in a comment awhile back and I continue to see people mentioning their tanks have a hard time picking up Onyxia in P3 while basically nobody recommends this strategy.

637,Should I complain about how players preformance in dungeons? / lf tanking advice,"I'm a warrior tank and really digging it. Now in my  30s and I feel I can tank fairly well with a decent group. And that's the thing, if the group works with me, tanking is a cake walk, if not, it's more of a pain. 
And that's the thing, I often want to tell other players to do certain things differently, but often I'm not 100% sure if I'm right and I also don't wanna start drama that makes a person leave. Therfore, to keep the group from not falling apart and get heated, I try just to shrug of the picky problems I may have.

But  yeah, will give a few examples of what I notice other players do that annoys me and makes tanking harder than it should IMO. 

1.
DPS pulling or attacking to quickly. This is us minor, but man, it's a bit frustrating as I'd personally prefer 1 to 2 seconds to build aggro. I also wanna do the pulls, as doing good pulls is a part of my job as a tank. 
2.
DPS attacking a mob I'm not focused on. So tanking multiple mobs is easy if DPS doesn't start all going on their seperate mob. If they all focused on the one I focus, I feel, personally, that makes tanking smoother. Additionally, me having to mark tarsh mobs and all that should really not be necessary. As a DPS you should too be paying a little bit of attention to what's going on. 
3.
Mages. Yes yes, mages are being witch hunted, but keep in mind I'm firstmost just asking how these issues should be delt with. I just had this mage who felt the need to use only AOE spells. And guess what the result of that was? Anyway, I'd prefer if they didn't. Unless AOE'ing certain groups of mobs just is the best way to deal with them. 
4.
I like priest healers and also have a priest myself. But don't use the shield, it makes me generate less rage. 
5.
DPS pulling aggro due to high DPS. I don't mind this that much, as if it happens, I kinda just let them offtank a bit. They are usually rogue and high level and can handle it. 


Also, I feel I've been a good boy if my damage taken is around 70%. Any opinions on this, or how you would measure your tanking preformance?

639,"Addons, UI design/layout and obsession","Back in the day, I used to spend hours designing and re-designing my UI with all sorts of addons to get the most out of it while retaining a minimalist approach. I love clean, crisp designs where only the absolutely necessary elements appear on screen without compromising your ability to raid/dungeon/PvP. For example, while I'd love a UI that only has player frames and a small amount of buttons, I'd miss out on being able to monitor the overall health of the raid using raid frames (even when not healing). Or be able to reach a button that isn't bound to a key because I press it once or twice on each login (e.g. profession windows, hearthstone) and mouse clicking is fine for that scenario.

I'm also not a huge fan of over-the-top addons that add all sorts of strange curves/lines/images to the UI. For example, changing your mana/energy/rage bar into a curved bar around your character (which always reminds of chefs who make food look fancy by smearing a sauce on a plate, it's just not necessary and detracts from what it's there to do!). The UI should melt into the background so that as much screen space as possible is dedicated to what your character is actually doing. If you can't see a mob or resource node because one of these addons has smeared itself across your screen, then you're doing it wrong!

Is anyone aware of fansites or corners of the web where I can find inspiration for new designs/layouts and new addons that can re-invent how you play WoW? Does anyone else share this massive time waste of a hobby and want to share their UI so others like me can obsess over the tiny details that make a design great?

I code for a living but haven't attempted to make an addon for WoW yet. For those who have, is it worth doing? Last time I checked, they were written in the LUA scripting language right? I'm a massive fan of C#, .NET Core etc, so are there any similarities or is it more like JavaScript?",1571091818.0,"Addons, UI design/layout and obsessionBack in the day, I used to spend hours designing and re-designing my UI with all sorts of addons to get the most out of it while retaining a minimalist approach. I love clean, crisp designs where only the absolutely necessary elements appear on screen without compromising your ability to raid/dungeon/PvP. For example, while I'd love a UI that only has player frames and a small amount of buttons, I'd miss out on being able to monitor the overall health of the raid using raid frames (even when not healing). Or be able to reach a button that isn't bound to a key because I press it once or twice on each login (e.g. profession windows, hearthstone) and mouse clicking is fine for that scenario.

I'm also not a huge fan of over-the-top addons that add all sorts of strange curves/lines/images to the UI. For example, changing your mana/energy/rage bar into a curved bar around your character (which always reminds of chefs who make food look fancy by smearing a sauce on a plate, it's just not necessary and detracts from what it's there to do!). The UI should melt into the background so that as much screen space as possible is dedicated to what your character is actually doing. If you can't see a mob or resource node because one of these addons has smeared itself across your screen, then you're doing it wrong!

Is anyone aware of fansites or corners of the web where I can find inspiration for new designs/layouts and new addons that can re-invent how you play WoW?

654,Healing 5-mans vs Raids,"I've been levelling a priest (nearly 40 atm), and really enjoying my dungeon healing. I've just started looking at a few healing guides and am trying to understand the difference between dungs and raids.

I figured out that in dungeons, big slow heals are king - dropping two or three healbombs then stopping casting for the 5-second rule to regen a load of mana means that you can sustain for longer.

\---

A guide I read today finally explained the benefit of down-ranking to me, which is +heal gear. When a 200-mana/600hp (3:1 hp/mana) down-ranked heal gets +200hp it gives 4:1 hp/mana. When an 800-mana/2400hp (3:1 hp/mana) gets the same +200hp, it only becomes 3.25:1, which is much less efficient.

The guide said that typically in raids you'll be casting down-ranked spells almost constantly, using +mp5 and +heal gear to give mana-efficient heals for a longer period of time than you could sustain use healbombs like in a dungeon.

\---

I understand that down-ranking is pointless without +heal gear, hence why healbombs are the go-to dungeon strategy.

The question I have is this: when you get to the point of being able to raid heal with +mp5/+heal gear, do you continue to healbomb in dungeons, and if so, why? At that point, is it not just more efficient to heal like you would in a raid?",1571088840.0,"Healing 5-mans vs RaidsI've been levelling a priest (nearly 40 atm), and really enjoying my dungeon healing.

I see the same rogue running on the path ahead of me.  I take and angle to cut him off.  He spots me before he is in range goes stealth.  I, again, used perception, and spam AE.  He blinds me, gets behind me and then insta-kills again.

I know some of the spells are by preference (for example stealth) but I'm not sure about the most optimal stamina/armor choices. 

Also does higher level stealth reduce the chance of spotting my pet or does it only affect the movement and damage?

695,[BUG] Bosses in UBRS have incorrect level,"Pyroguard Emberseer, Warchief Rend Blackhand, The Beast, and General Drakkisath all have the incorrect level in Classic WoW. They are level 60, 62, 62, and 62 elites, respectively, when they should all be level ?? bosses. This seems to be due to changes in WotLK and Cataclysm that have carried over into the Classic client without being fixed.

EDIT: This also seems to be affecting Teremus the Devourer, who is a level 60 elite instead a level ?? boss (he was changed shortly before the release of Cataclysm).

At level 27 i've got Improved Aspect of the Hawk (5% chance per shot to get +30% ranged attack speed for 12 seconds)

If i have 2 bows, both dealing 15 DPS, but one is 1.5 attack speed, and the other is 3.0 attack speed, which is better?

If i was marksman, slower is better due to Aimed shot interrupting basic attacks. But as BM, Most is instant (Arcane and serpents) and most has set damage. Multishot being the only thing different, as it is instant still, but does 1 shots worth of damage.

With just multishot, you'd want the slower bow because of higher burst. But, while leveling your not (hopefully) fighting that many targets. In a dungeon, sure. 

My main problem is the Improved hawk. I need to shoot faster to trigger it more often. But the increased speed is less of a bonus on a faster weapon from what i understand. I was told 30% of 3.0 is .9 (dropping it to 2.1) while 30% of 1.5 is .45 (dropping it to 1.15). meaning slower weapons get twice the bonus(?). Now, how to calculate this for the damage output of fast and slow weapons? I don't know. Hopefully someone can math this all out for me. <3

Add in the fact that a scope changes it alot. +2 on a 1.5 is double the use of it on a 3.0

While lvling, i've jsut been grabbing the higher dps one. If its fast i'll burn some coin on a scope. If its slow, i wont.

So I decided to go out there and search for the chicken to check if it'll be back soon, while my girl waited there so we don't miss it.

Suddenly I spotted a Human Paladin who fought off some mobs to defend that chicken. Altough he was a Paladin, he was going to die since the enemy outnumbered him by far. I jumped off my Kodo, charged into the enemy lines and mass spotted those damn dogs. 

When they were done the Paladin /thanked me. I /bowed and /pointed at the chicken to make him understand that I'll help him out. This way it should go way faster and we could start the quest without waiting too long.

The last group of attackers came and we fought them off together. When we defeated them, I /waved goodbye, he /thanked me again, I jumped on my Kodo and rode back to my girl.

When I arrived she already had started the quest and we escorted the chicken on it's epic journey through dessert.

It was about the time we encountered the first group of mobs when suddenly one of them got stunned by a Hammer of Justice. I looked around and there he was. The Paladin I helped out before came back to pay his debts. 

He accompanied us until the last attacker was defeated. We /thanked him and /waved goodbye once again. I thought to myself, we would meet again, dear friend. But until now we didn't.

This was my finest experience with an alliance player this far. Shoutout to you, dear Paladin! May your ways be safe and your loot be good!",1571075014.0,"Opposing faction mustn't be your enemyThis happened on Everlook (PvE)

727,Undead Warlock looking for Engineering advice.,"Hey. I am an Undead Warlock with 300 Tailoring and Mining. My thought was to get mining while leveling and gather the mats needed to max engineering when i make the swap. But i need advice on two things. 


-What veins should i farm with mining before replacing it with Engineering?Is it even worth it or should i farm gold with other methods (Mara,DM) and just buy what i need for my engineering crafts?


-What is the best engineering expertise for me? Gnomish Or Goblin? Considering that i won't have mining at all and just buy my mats from the ah eventually, should i go with one or the other because of bops,etc? What are the pros and cons of each?


-More of a warlock question but how should i approach raid pvp battles ( mostly before raids like Ony and MC where opposing faction guilds are preparing and make it hard to even enter the instance ). Do i stay in range and dot? Aoe ? Use engineering to get close and aoe with hellfire and engineering consumables?

739,Farming Humanoids vs Beasts(with skinning) for Gold ?,"Hi,

I often find myself in a situation where I don't have any quests in a zone and rather that switching zone I prefer farming mobs for gold and exp.  Which is better between those two sitations in terms of gold income?

1: Farm humanodis, vendor everything and sell cloth at AH

2: Farm beasts, skin them and vendor everything

I \*think\* humanoids are better because they drop gold (less space in bag taken) and I have the impression that they drop  green or white/gray stuff more often than beast, (with a good vendor price on those), and that the cloth can really make a nice income if sold at AH.

751,The actual solution to bad actors hijacking World chat and banning everyone.,"This  has happened on several servers and since it happened on mine I have become well-versed in the advanced chat commands over the past few days.

First of all, **/chathelp** will give the command list.
You can join the channel on an unbanned character. Issue a **/chatwho World** command and request a **/unban World [playername]** from the owner or any mods.
 
The channel owner will be marked with a **'\*'**

The channel moderators will be marked with a **'@'**

Once all the bad guys have logged off and good guys have control of World once again you can ask nicely and they'll let you rejoin.

**THE PROBLEM THO:** There is no command available to echo the ban list from a custom chat channel. That's what really makes the World chat trolling persistent. Otherwise as soon as a benevolent player got control of the channel they could undo all of the bans then and there.

Including people who don't know how or don't want to go through the effort of getting unbanned.

757,DPS guide to 5-man dungeons from a tank. Mobs hate this one rule!,"Since there's a post complaining about dungeon tanking, here's how DPS should behave to make basically everything dungeon wise in the game trivial.

Open up with everything thing you got on the skull in 3-4 mob packs(*).  Go a bit slower if it's 1 mob or taunt immune (rare). The idea here is to obliterate skull before it does anything.  Generally this will be a caster or some other soft/priority target.  Don't worry about aggro, even as cloth.  The tank should toss a taunt on this mob if it looks dangerous, otherwise the tank can safely leave it alone.

After skull dies, move to the next target.  Ideally, all DPS would pick the same one because that's by far the most efficient way to do it, but it's impractical in most cases to coordinate.  Try anyway.

Tanks are supposed to out threat everyone on all mobs.  This is literally impossible (as in not enough GCDs/rage) when DPS all pick different targets at the start.  Threat generation on a mob governs how much damage you can safely do. If a tank has to split threat 5 ways, you won't be able to go all out on one without pulling threat.  But if a tank distributes threat 1 way at 90%, 4 ways at 2.5% on the rest, you can go at whatever that 90% threat/second for all DPS on that one target instead of 20% in the split case.

(*) - the reason this works is due to how taunt works.  Taunt (when successful) will equalize threat of the taunter to the person with highest threat and steal focus.  To make a mob lose focus you must have more than 110% threat of focus target in melee, and 130% in range.  If a tank makes the initial threat steal from taunt as big as possible via large initial damage, they might not even need to actively generate threat on it any more to keep focus before the mob dies.

Easy rules and will trivialize a lot of stuff.  If things are dying at nearly the same time without AoE usage, you are doing it wrong! When single target (or small AoE like cleave, blade flurry, etc.), kill as fast as you can then all move to the same next one.  Let the tank worry about healer threat because it's pretty easy to do.

Actual AoE spells are a whole other thing and its painful to try to compete against it as a warrior.  If you are gonna AoE, be damn sure you can kill the mobs before they kill you.",1571069416.0,"DPS guide to 5-man dungeons from a tank.

Tanks are supposed to out threat everyone on all mobs.  This is literally impossible (as in not enough GCDs/rage) when DPS all pick different targets at the start.  Threat generation on a mob governs how much damage you can safely do. If a tank has to split threat 5 ways, you won't be able to go all out on one without pulling threat.  But if a tank distributes threat 1 way at 90%, 4 ways at 2.5% on the rest, you can go at whatever that 90% threat/second for all DPS on that one target instead of 20% in the split case.

(*) - the reason this works is due to how taunt works.  Taunt (when successful) will equalize threat of the taunter to the person with highest threat and steal focus.  To make a mob lose focus you must have more than 110% threat of focus target in melee, and 130% in range.  If a tank makes the initial threat steal from taunt as big as possible via large initial damage, they might not even need to actively generate threat on it any more to keep focus before the mob dies.

Easy rules and will trivialize a lot of stuff.  If things are dying at nearly the same time without AoE usage, you are doing it wrong! When single target (or small AoE like cleave, blade flurry, etc.), kill as fast as you can then all move to the same next one.  Let the tank worry about healer threat because it's pretty easy to do.

Actual AoE spells are a whole other thing and its painful to try to compete against it as a warrior.  If you are gonna AoE, be damn sure you can kill the mobs before they kill you.",0

771,"Warrior talent build challenge (alliance, no pvp, no raiding, w/ pocket healer)","Hi guys,

Trying to find some help deciding about where to put my talent points as a new warrior (level 20). I'm playing with my wife who is running as a priest, and we're playing on a PvE server (i have PvP server alts tho, but that's not relevant). Basically what I'm looking for is a good, fun PvE leveling build that takes all of these factors into account, which I believe eliminates the need for a lot of cookie-cutter PvP/raid/sustainability builds!

* Pocket healer available at all times since we're leveling together (minimal/non-existent downtime or need for ""oh shit"" skills). 
* No PvP focus at this time, might respec when BGs come out if I want to try some PvP but there will be no world PvP to take into consideration (i.e. hamstring, mortal strike for the heal debuff in a PvP setting, etc.).
* Since we have kids and are taking it fairly slow I'm not really expecting to be raiding anytime soon - if ever. So the focus is leveling/""world PvE"".
* Will most likely need/want to tank some 5-mans here and there, but from what I've read low level tanking isn't really affected that much by talents (not going to level full prot, no :-)). 
* Playing alliance (Nelf, don't tease me too bad) so no WF.
* Few, if any, BiS items to be expected so min-maxing with gear will be hard unfortunately

So when I take all of this into consideration I can't really seem to find a good build guide, I guess it's not super common to play PvE with a healer at all times and not have an end-game focus though so I'm not very surprised. That's why I'm reaching out to you guys to see if anyone has any fun theorycrafting ideas. Until now I've just put some points into crit/parry without thinking too much about it, but I kind of feel like I need to decide about where I want to be in like 10 levels.

Dual wield doesn't feel viable since I won't be running dungeons to get all BiS stuff and maximize hit/crit, so I'm looking at a 2H (hoping to get WW axe @30ish) build with the 1h+shield supplement for tanking if needed. Perhaps focus on slam? 

I would be super grateful if someone with more experience could chip in with some pros/cons and (if possible) give me some help choosing which talents to get and skip as I'm leveling (like I said, 20 now and I have no idea which ones to get even at the first tiers!).  I have some ideas and questions, like:

* Stance dancing won't be used much (no PvP/raiding) - skip tactical mastery/anger management? 
* Don't really need to hamstring kite due to healer
* Downtime between mobs not a huge issue despite no Anger management if we're just running in a leveling zone tagging mob after mob? Rage won't have time to drop too much I believe...
* Mortal Strike healing debuff useful for PvP, perhaps points better spent elsewhere for pure PvE? Bloodthirst > MS in this case?
* Giving up Sweeping Strikes if going Fury (not thinking level 60 build here, but rather during leveling @ like 25, 30, 35, 40, etc.) - will it suck not having it? Also for aggro purposes when tanking 5-mans.
* Booming voice to increase area for shouts mostly used to catch rogues in stealth (PvP) - skip?
* Piercing howl good for PvP, perhaps skip this as well? (""oh shit"" button for sure, but with priest fear maybe it's unnecessary points)
* Can't abuse /sit for enrage procs
* Arms has a lot of damage boosting talents, not sure if that's more efficient leveling-wise than fury which seems to focus a bit more on procs (flurry, enrage, blood craze).
* Perhaps with all the ""extra points"" I can save by not taking cookie-cutter talents, some could even go into protection? Haven't really looked at that tree too much to be honest.

- Fight or Flight: if any opposing faction gets attacked or feels threatened first, they will attack you and call for more powerful backup or run for their life. 

- Ignore: If you don’t target or acknowledge the opposing faction, they’re less likely to attack you. Some of them want to be left alone and level as much as you do.

- Emotes: by emoting with /wave /salute /bow the opposite faction is more likely to reciprocate and not attack you.

- Reciprocation and Revenge: chances are that 8+ level ganking you was ganked by your faction too and they’re out for revenge. There are players in your faction just as bad as the opposing faction (sometimes worse).

- Respect: honestly I get the PvP aspect, you chose that realm so you should understand ganking is gonna happen. But you’re all in the same boat trying to level and have fun.

I felt like we need a post where we can collect all the questions for Blizzcon. I will start with the first question and keep on adding the questions people may have down in the comments to this post.

Questions:

* 1. Now with phase 2 around the corner, do you have any plans on fixing  the lag that occurs in large scale of PVP?
* 2. Do you have any plan on how to deal with the massive queues we still have (on EU it's usually around 1-2 hours)? 
* 3.  What are you stances about terrain exploiting in dungeons? Is it something your looking to penalize or prohibit in any way going forward? (Examples: Solo angerforge, ZF graveyard farm, dm tribute run solo.)
* 4. I want to know whether they plan on upgrading Classic with unique content, or whether they're going to release an expansion per year.
* 5. Will Realm transfers / Faction change become a thing?",1571058913.0,"Blizzcon QuestionsHey there,

821,GDKP - raiding for profit.,"So with master loot back one of the most popular ways of pugging raids, GDKP (gold-DKP), is possible again.

So what does this mean? Well TL;DR you use your gold as points to bid on items.

The gold is accumulated into a pot and then at the end of the raid, it's distributed evenly to all people present in the raid (with some caveats which I will outline later)

There's two great advantages of this system:

1. Cutting edge players who are bored with nothing to do can make some money. Some people don't like farming consumables or materials for their raids and this provides another income source option for those people.

2. Players who have more money than ability to raid (either due to schedule, disability, etc) can actually get some epic loot! GDKP runs are very inclusive and the only thing required is gold.

So going into this raid, you're guaranteed gold at the very least instead of spending gold on consumables and repairs. 

---------------------------------------------------------

**So how does it work?**

The first thing you need is a balance on ""carries"" and the ""bidders"". What this means is that you need a minimum amount of geared and skilled players to clear the raid as well as enough gold from the bidders to make it worth the raiders' time. There may also be competent players with some gold who are just after a very specific item (petrified leaf for example).

This is usually done by setting minimum bids on items usually a standard price (say 100g) and then higher on certain high-value items such as bindings or eye of sulfuras. The other thing you to make sure is that bidders actually have money, this can be done in many ways but with discord being so easily available a simple DM with a screenshot of their gold is enough.

This will take time to set up, it's not something you advertise in LFG on the night you want to run it. The first run you do needs a week at least gathering people and advertising on the realm forums and realm reddit etc.

Once the first run has been successful, then it's smooth sailing from there. You'll have lot's of signups for future runs.

----------------------------------------------

Second thing that needs to happen to establish clear rules on your bidding system

You can't be wishy-washy with this and take ages with loot and bidding, it needs to be efficient and professional. Setting up macros for this will be essential for a smooth experience for everyone.

Examples of a good bidding system:

* Enforce a minimum bid increase, so people don't just continually try and outbid each other by 1 copper. 20g is a sensible amount for example.

* Set a timer, you want to keep the raid moving and not wait around for too long. For example make a bidding phase last 60 seconds, reset bidding time to 15 seconds if someone makes another bid.

* any item not bid on will be disenchanted (not sure if it's possible to get nexus crystals yet though?) and added to the collection of boe and mats.

* all non-bop items will be auctioned off at the end of the run all at once as the ""goody bag"", so things like cores, greens, blues and any shards etc.

* there is no mainspec or offspec priority, the only priority here is gold.

* all bids are to be made in raid chat, this is a public auction after all.

-------------------------------------------------

Third is the rest of the stuff, gold distribution and in raid rules.

* People who leave before raid is ended forfeit their entire share to their replacement

* Disconnects will be removed (if not announced with a reason) after 10 minutes and share forfeited to their replacement.

* Any action made to jeopardise the success of the raid (ninjapulling, suiciding, etc) will first be given a warning and then removed, forfeiting their share to their replacement.

* Gold will be split between all raiders +1 (so if 40 people present then the total gold is divided by 41), the extra share goes to the raid leader for organisation compensation. This might seem controversial but overall this makes you look more trustworthy as you are saying up front what you want to take from the raid instead of making it look too good to be true and then ninjaing all the gold.

-----------------------------------------

So right now there isn't quite the market for this yet (I think) as most of even the top tier guilds are still gearing their own raiders, however since the maximum number of people in an instance is 10, some of the higher level dungeons (especially with Dire Maul dropping in soon) can be run as GDKP too. Most of these can be cleared with 5 people so that's 5 potential bidders on items.

The thing is, leveling is crawling by. I know it’s supposed to slow down and this isn’t necessarily my first rodeo, but 5+ hours to level as a hunter seems slow at this level. Maybe I’m just off base here and need to git gud. 

The main problem I have is that I play between 12am-6am most nights since I work night shifts. It’s almost impossible to find groups.  Luckily I was able to get the ZF mallet, so that might actually help me find some groups, but it’s really very difficult. Dire Maul is out tomorrow but I’m not sure I’m high enough level since different websites give different level ranges.

So since grinding dungeons is mostly out (and not as efficient), where is the best place to level? I have Questie and it shows a couple places, but not really any high-density questing areas. That is to say, most places “my level” show only two quests or so.

835,Should we gloss it over as THE CLASSIC EXPERIENCE,"Server is Deviate Delight. There's a lvl 60 human mage named Haily who's been camping the horde FP north of Gadgetzan for a few days now. You know the drill. She can hurl spells on you from afar without aggroing the guards but the minute you even shield yourself the goblins come after you.

I am actually not so much pissed by her as by her sidekick Kinhj, who's a level 45 dwarf pally. I believe Kinhj did not have any prior relationship with Haily but decided to stay as the servant after witnessing the massacre. What annoys me is just that he's useless in battles and wouldn't even give the bubble to the mage daddy. Yet he is the one who's doing all the emotes (lol) and basking in another asshole's glory. It is all like ""mage daddy is here! I'm a pvp God by extension!!!"" 

Things apparently get worse now, as Haily's behavioral art has acquired a cult following. They start sniping lowbies from rooftops in the city. And they extended their activities to Booty Bay. Some are trying to mass-report the mage, since rooftops killing is bannable. I don't know. I honestly don't even care about the camping or the sniping since lowbies often put up a good fight when we can. It's the sidekicking that just downright disgusts me, but it's not even reportable. Is it just typical classic WOW experience or is this pally exceptionally toxic?

Second: the group disband because not enough people join and the person reserving stuff doesn't get what he wants.

In both cases you have no penalties if you joined them or ignored them. You know beforehand which items are not obtainable(case being you know when to join a reserved raid without having to miss out on loot).

In both cases you have no penalties if you joined them or ignored them. You know beforehand which items are not obtainable(case being you know when to join a reserved raid without having to miss out on loot). 

Nobody is forcing you to join a raid with reservations so i really don't get why everybody is so extra mad and salty about things that have no impact on them.

Puggers themselves are the cause...,"Because it's a shit job to do, while not earning any special privileges in return for it, despite you're 9 out of 10 automatically forced to lead the raid if you're the designated tank. What you're basically signing up for is to be Jesus. Meaning that when you're doing everything right 99% of the time, everyone finds that normal, but make a mistake, and you'll be upside down crucified. Dying because lack of healing? Your fault as a tank, because each time you're about to pull, you should send an ambassador to the healer's planet to ask if 100% mana is sufficient to pull on. DPS not following your markings? Well you should've double checked with everyone if everyone read the chat earlier. DPS pulling what they're not supposed to and dying to it? Your fault as a tank, because you should be nannying your group 24/7, looking forwards and backwards simultaneously and feel if there's a disturbance in the force.

DPSers always get away with shit they do, like aoe nuking everything, stealing groupwide aggro. Or in general not minding the threatmeter, killing the tank's rage. Or failing to properly cc a marked mob when requested. No one ever got kicked for that, or yelled at for that, in any group I've been in since Classic. Ever. For some strange reason, people find that normal. At least these days.

I also thought it’s a healthy rivalry, we (as horde) call the alliance scum, and they say we live in mud huts. Thought it was standard to take pride in your faction. And if you see the other faction you trash talk them. To keep the fighting spirit alive. 

But it seems like it’s only a horde thing, I have said a couple of bad things about alliance on shared discord (we were organising world pvp battle) and reddit and people have lost their shit, I didn’t even say anything too extreme I just called them alliance scum jokingly. They got so mad they were requesting the admin to ban me from the discord server. 

I never got mad when people trash talk the horde, I thought it’s just part of the game. If we don’t beef there won’t be world pvp raids and those are extremely fun. That’s how I see the situation, and I can swallow a couple of insults aimed at me if that means majority of the players have more fun with the game. 

That’s just my opinion and experience in the server I play on, I can imagine some servers have it the other way around horde being the bitchbois.

Here's the video: https://youtu.be/MWBBL991aDY

The method does need to have leatherworking at level 280+. You will also need an enchanting skill of level 1 (you can do this with a level 5 alt) 

The flip is a simple one. Craft Wicked Leather Headbands, disenchant them and then sell the mats. 

The Headband requires 12 Rugged Leather and I tend to only buy Rugged leather at 7 silver each through trade chat. Obviously, you can go and farm this yourself for 100% profit (minus the rune thread and dye), it’s completely up to you.

Now, the reason why this flip is pretty insane is that there’s around a 30% chance of getting 1-2 Greater Eternal Essence. On my server and many others, these are around 4g50s each, which is pretty much 3.7x the crafting cost of the Headband. So there’s a lot of room for profit with this flip, especially if you hit a string of 2x Eternal Essences.

Obviously you will have to check your server for the essence prices to see if this is worth it.",1571018160.0,"I made a video guide for the Wicked Leather Headband gold flip.Hey dudes, I made a video guide for the Wicked Leather Headband flip.

Level 12 defended himself by saying that it was an upgrade (even a shitty upgrade is better than a white), and that he waited until he saw no one else roll need on it to make sure he wasn't ganking it from someone. Level 22 mage still berates him, then proceeds to aggro 2 or 3 groups of the searing blade casters and warriors, then start running and blinking to the entrance. When I said that doing that was a dick move, his final words were ""So isn't not sharing, so you can all spend money repairing your stuff.""

No real point to this story other than writing it for your amusement. What are some of your stories from bad dungeon groups (or in my case, 1 really toxic guy)? On a side note, does anyone agree with the 22 mage?",1571017298.0,"Here's my recent bad dungeon story. What's yours?I was healing a group in RFC on my lowbie priest.

1059,Massive potential for abuse of right-click reporting!,"Hello,  I'd like to start this post off by saying I have been account silenced twice now by a raid of 25+ people who spam right click report when they aren't happy.

&#x200B;

The first time, I randomly walked in on a ""Guild meeting"" some people were having, and stood on one of the tables and said ""I'm gay"". Since they happened to be a homophobic guild, they all mass reported me because of it (they literally said in /say that is why they are reporting me). I was nearly instantly silenced. I made a ticket, and the GM reversed the silence (after almost 12 hours of being silenced). This blatantly hateful, homophobic guild has faced no consequences as a result of this whatsoever.

&#x200B;

The second time, which just happened yesterday, was when I was going to UBRS to run Rend/Jed runs with my guild. There was a raid of around \~30 level 60 hordes camping the enterance killing anyone who tried to enter. I blinked past them, Ice Blocked, Cold Snapped, Ice Blocked and then blinked into the instance once it was off cooldown. They apparently didn't like that I got past them without dying, so they mass right-click reported me. I got nearly instantly silenced again. The problem is, this time, the GM who reviewed my case seems to believe that this justifies my **FOUR DAY** account silence. I have not said anything bad, other than the ""F"" word in a GUILD RAID when we wiped. The only other thing I have said is ""LF#M UBRS JED/REND FARM NEED TANK"". Now, that isn't even the big problem here, which is ridiculous.

&#x200B;

**The big problem here, is during PvP raids, if someone in the raid notices an enemy healer doing a great job and keeping everyone up, all they have to do is tell the entire raid to right-click report for spam and the healer will be instantly disconnected from the servers while their account silence is applied. I am not sure how many reports it takes, but it may even be possible to do this in battlegrounds once they are released.**

Now, I used to play in Vanilla and in the PvP server I was playing on, Southshore was camped every day by members or a Horde guild in T1/T2. This was in Dec 2005, Patch 1.9.

I was level 35. I remember trying to support Alliance 60's and do PvP inside the village of Southshore versus the Horde level 60 Rogues.

It was futile because my shots had like 30% chance to miss, my Concussive Shots and Scatter Shots missed or got resisted. 

The level 60 Rogues also resisted my traps. Frost Trap and Freezing Trap had no effect vs them because they ""RESISTed"" them. Freezing Traps just despawned when they stepped over them and Frost Traps simply did not trigger at all./

In this video you will see the Dwarf effortlessly trapping the 60 Rogue once or twice. Now, the Freezing Trap is a spell. If you tried that on a 39 Mage you'd get constant resists but apararently the Dwarf's Freezing Traps don't get resisted.

Full story:

As you know you can simply listen to Battle Log event using WA and add a notification while seeing Dodge in battle, but this lead to 2 problems. First it consumes CPU for listening and second you have to manually set period of activation which is not precise.

Additionally, if you are already using TMW, why bother installing WA? WOW must has a variable to store to value.

After digging into the code, I found it's actually using ComboPoint to trigger Overpower. However, TMW is using GetComboPoints method in lua, but this won't fetch the true ComboPoint data (probably this method will always return 0 cause we are warriors). Instead, I used UnitPoint method to get real combo points data which works like a charm. When the combo point equals to 1, it means you are able to use Overpower!

This way you are exactly binding the notification to the game attribute and this is most efficient and accurate. This notification use lua code instead of TMW pre-coded conditions.

1081,Protection paladin leveling stat priority,"I'm leveling a prot pally, just running lots of dungeons and occasionally questing. Currently level 40.

Throughout the 30s I prirotized getting gear with stamina as first priority, and intelligence second priority, because without mana I'm useless, so that just made sense to me. After a million SM runs I ended up getting a lot of stam/str gear and I've decided to try it out, as all the guides I've seen all say to prioritize stam/str

Is there a good reason for this? Does it only matter at higher levels? Because for now, limiting my mana pool feels kind of bad. I don't notice it too much in runs that go well, but whenever shit goes sideways and I have to judge more and drop more consecrations, it feels real bad as I run out of mana right away.

The guy who told me they become unsheepable when elites are dead is an experienced RL and is clearing MC already. But why is what he is saying happens totally different than what the guide says ?

i've been quite surprised by how well this spec performs in raids. This is mostly a ""positive overview"" - **edit:** I don't dive deep on the value of it vs a regular shadow priest. Most shadow priests ATM are doing great boss damage but very low trash damage. Only the top parsing spriests are doing well on trash relative to other casters, I imagine they're spamming max rank mind flay and chugging major manas and runes on cooldown. I would argue its much easier to just play this spec than to invest that much into keeping up with mages/warlocks. As gear improves spriests will continue to get weaker.

1126,"You don't need to be nice, but don't be a jerk","Recently, I was having tons of fun leveling my alt. She is level 15. Rogue. I logged in, and headed to Westfall. I had a quest to kill Defias Looter and Pillagers. And holy moly, the Pillager's Fire bolt hits like a truck. I died like 3 times in a row. I came back to resurrect. And a NE warrior walking by invited me. It seemed like he was having the same struggle. I accepted, and typed hello. He did not say anything back. He set the loot 'free for all'. I was like whatever, he's here to quest as well. Let's kill stuff!

The Pillager were more OP than I ever imagined. The NE Warrior died like 6 times within 10 minutes. The problem was that we were keep randomly getting aggroed. He was also a bit underlevled. Then he said ""brb"". I said okay. While he was gone, I figured out that I must play very careful here. I started to engage with Stealth + Garrote. And Sap if there were two of them stacked close together. Soon after, I was done with the quest. It went smooth.

He was still afk. I waited a little. He came back. I asked him ""Hey, how many you left?"". I wanted to help him before I leave. He was barely winning a 1vs1 battle against a Pillager. He had no chance to beat if it's 1vs2. He didn't respond me back. He just started to charge to the closest mob. I was like, okay, I help you anyways. So we started killing things together.

A few minutes later, we killed a mob, and it dropped a green cloak.+2 Stamina and +1 Strength. I happened to loot it, because you know, I clicked it. I was like wow, this is a legit back for a warrior. I knew that I was going to hand him the cloak. I dragged the item from my inventory, and clicked on his toon. As the trade window pops, he types: ""@#@$ off you !@#$@ hole""

I was confused. So that was obviously f words. But why do I deserve to be treated like that? I typed: ""What?"". He didn't say anything back, he just wanted to accept the trade. And then I realized what was going on. He was angry that I picked up that cloak.

While I understand that some people can be frustrated when they don't get what they wanted, you cannot say f words right away. Just simply ask, ""Can I have that? I need it."" Then it's done. You'll get it.

Anyways, I was left speechless for a moment. But you know, it happens. I must move on. Just wanted to share a meaningless story.

I want something like this so that I can more accurately track what drops from what mobs and find new places to grind for things and it makes it incredibly easy to track with an addon like this.

1284,My best advise at leveling efficiently and actually achieving level 60.,"I think it’s obvious that a spell cleave aoe farm is probably the absolute best way to level but this is my suggestion if your not doing that 100% of the time. 

I scroll r/classicwow daily and I’m glad to see how many new players there are asking for help and advise about leveling faster.I’m not by any means a veteran but I found these things to be deceiving to say the least... let me explain. 

I think for a semi hard core player that doesn’t have a super guild or friends to min max with then this is a good guideline. 

Dungeons are usually a big waste of time in most cases if your trying to level efficiently. For example: joining a player or two for a SM run. So bam you got three members already, might as well start heading to the dungeon... leave your location to the nearest FP, possibly take the boat to eastern island, then fp again , then take that nice long run to the dungeon so you can wait for the rest of the squad.  

So yea 20 min later and maybe you got a full group ready to start dungeon.. are there no low levels you are Carrying/slowing you down? How many times are you going to run it? I’d say there’s usually always one lower level, and that the group gets disbanded or loses a few members after a completed run..
So here we are again waiting, hoping for a solid member that will spam the dungeon. 

My point is that unless you have a great group or guild willing to efficiently spam dungeons with you then your better off grinding and questing for exp. there’s little to no down time. It’s consistent loot and exp. 

The only time I dungeon right now (lvl37) is if I got a good group and I will get a summon.

I just see people ask everyday if they should stop leveling at 52 + and spec towards dungeons and what not.. I honestly hate doing dungeons with people who are 8 levels below me or even level 57s trying to run scholo or strat...  

More and more of my friends are stuck around this level range and start alts cause they can’t level fast enough and just give up. I just think it’s to temping for people to start trying for gear and there tired of the grind by then. 

As you can probably tell by now it’s sort of a pride thing and I just feel like people are taking the easy route by hoping for dungeon runs from experienced/ higher leveled people who know how to do the dungeon properly. 
This is more aimed towards people who actually are looking for the best exp, cause doing dungeons all day on a healthy server isn’t a bad idea either as it can gear you very well for the next levels to come.

1323,How to get people together to do something?,"Hi guys.

I really don't understand how some of you manage to get people to work together for 1 particular objective that is NOT getting bis items or something intended in the game.

For example, I remember reading someone saying ""I love my guild, if someone needs something, we all put what we are doing aside and go help that someone"". And I'm like ""What? Who does that?"". The vast majority of people I meet are such in a hurry, they don't want to give you 2 min if that doesn't benefit them.

Another example is the person that made a thread about his twink and people helped him to get the arena trinket.

One thing that seem to help getting people together is knowing each other outside the game.

Another example. So today I was in a group for a full UBRS run (so we need like 10 people), the group was almost full, suddenly, the group leader left. And I tried my hardest to find other members. But the group crumbled, 1 guy left, 2 guys left. It seemed to be a psychological thing, like oh the leader left, the group cannot continue. And we had an almost full group with tank and healer.

Another example, I just can't get people from my guild to make a group. I feel like I'm being rude for asking people from my guild to come to my group.

Maybe I'm being too ""nice"" with guilds? You see if I talk to a guild leader from a guild I want to join, I just hope they accept me. I don't ask ""Ok, what do I gain from joining your guild?"", I'm like ""Oh ok, I will do this, I will do that"". So basically, I don't see a difference between being in my guild and being with no guild.

&#x200B;

Can you share some stories you have with guilds? Where you gathered together to team play, I'm not talking about gathering to do a raid, I'm talking about you and your guild got organized to rule the AH or something cool like that. I like to read those. :)

If you have any piece of advice to help me find people that can gather and do great things together, I will be very happy to read it.

So basically, I don't see a difference between being in my guild and being with no guild.

&#x200B;

Can you share some stories you have with guilds? Where you gathered together to team play, I'm not talking about gathering to do a raid, I'm talking about you and your guild got organized to rule the AH or something cool like that. I like to read those. :)

If you have any piece of advice to help me find people that can gather and do great things together, I will be very happy to read it.

(also sorry, I'm not good at organizing ideas in a good manner, so everything goes in all directions I guess)",0

While reading the comments I came across an interesting thought and I wanted to hear your opinions on it.

The barber profession!

I’ve not given much detailed thought to it but it would works like this:
To keep the RPG elements of the game the barber is actually an profession you can learn. 

You sell hair dye directly as a ware which can be used on Charakters. You craft it by using herbs, maybe some new implemented. 
Then there would be earrings and piercings you craft with metals like copper bronze or gold etc. and be able to sell them like any other wares. 

The most important one would be the hair cutting and other hair styling techniques. You need to craft the scissors and whatever would be necessary for styling. The styles drop like schematics or can be learned the traditional way from other master barbers. Maybe there is a hidden, dead one in scholomance. 

Then the customer opens a new window with the barber, presumably inside a Capital next to a barber shop. Those could maybe be present in other cities too.

The rest would maybe work like in retail or differently. Can’t really think of a better way right now. You pay and get the hair cut. Prices might be fixed for each style depending on the rarity. 

For some styles there would be reagents necessary to make it more interesting. And creating the dye would give the barber skill points. 

 In summary this new profession would combine aspects of inscription and the current barber.",1570937140.0,"Barber? Is there an alternative?Recently I’ve stumbled across many posts regarding a barber for Classic wow in the official forums. Some are for and most are against it.

1448,Dungeon Finder by Questshares,"Hello to everyone,

Had created a same app for Hearthstone called Questshares and now create something for World of Warcraft Classic that basicly is a **Dungeon/RAID finder helper**

&#x200B;

**What is the goal?**

Finally we can have a player base where the good players can be reward and the bad players can actually improve them self. Imagine we could track the community history reputation of all players since 2004. Now it's a reality.

&#x200B;

**How does the community reputation works?**

Each player can only get a vote from each battle tag, so it's hard to gain community reputation.

&#x200B;

**Why I did this?**

When was farming the way up to Rank 14 has Warrior was so hard for me to keep remembering the names of good players to join the premade based on their skill. Daily more than 10 different players joined and I couldn't track the best ones and somehow I lost good friendships because of that! So I decided to create it, not because I'll go do that crazy rank 14, but to help others to achieve it :)

&#x200B;

**What if the community doesn't want?**

Well, that their choice, to either use or not the Quest Shares, at least they have that option!

&#x200B;

**Key features are :**

\- Unique Player reputation based on Blizzard® BattleTag®

\- Create different player profiles

\- Find the best players in the community

\- Join or Create great groups for best end game experience

\- Share your experience and submit feedback

&#x200B;

At the moment still on beta stage and in need of users to test and to give feedback ( yeap, just leave a comment ).

Hopefully will add more features ( PvP Premades, Quests )

1. Arena spectators don't drop aggro after Vanish. Sometimes I'll have a resist on a pickpocket and aggro all the arena spectators and then Vanish. Somehow they still keep attacking and kill me. It's super frustrating.
2. While I have Preparation, I average 2-3 resists per run and often have to blow it to get another Vanish out. This leaves me unable to Prep for a second Evasion against plugger which makes the fight tougher. It also makes me hesitant to keep pickpocketing as one more resist will result in me dying.
3. I can't LOS plugger. I watched a video where a guy LOS'd him to avoid his casts. However, every time I try to do this, plugger runs away and pulls in patrons and I die. Is this something that's patched now or is there some magic trick to it?

I'm close to whirlwind axe but the issue is I left my old guild to join my old raiding guild but no one is on and I can't find a new guild to join atm but I have no idea who would help me kill cyclonius since he is a high lvl mob. I've been getting the elemental charms by asking higher lvl players in arathi for helpi just need 4 water and 7 fire charms left. However, I am scared about Cyclonius because I hear he is a really high level, and I have no idea how I should get a group to like fight him off.

second question what skils should i train as a warrior? I've skipped a lot of thingsbut atm I only have max(what my lvl can call max) sunder armor because i think sunder armor is pretty good. I recently maxed out to the best of my ability my sunder armor and I purchased berserker rage. I have I think Rank 2 Rend and Rank 3 heroic strike, although I can't remember all the details on the top of my head.",1570922941.0,"Level 34 warrior, Axe and Skills question Okay so I'm 34

Thats why i started playing Warrior when classic launched.. but at lvl 30 i lost my fun playing it, so i played first time in my wow carrier a Hunter to level 60, the leveling was pure fun, but the playstyle on 60 isnt very fun for me. 

So i got back to my warrior and leveled him to 38, but again is lost my fun, even that i f**** love warriors. So i rerolled to shaman (also first time) played him to lvl 42 and it was fun, but again im not sure if thats really fun to play at 60. 

So now i want to level a Rogue, because i think its very fun to sneak and play pvp and open pvp. But i don't know what to tell my Guild.. there are enough Rogues etc. So i think, there want be any space for my rogue, and telling them that i will decide again for a new class is also really shit, so they will think that it can happen that i will reroll later.

I am having issues on my pick pocket runs in BRD.

The issue is that normal mobs (not the dogs) see right through my stealth. I am dodging the fire elementals too.

I am level 60 and my stealth is maxed at level 4. Master of Deception is at  5/5. From what I have read/seen, mobs should be unable to see me at lv 4 stealth and lv 60 alone. People have repeatedly told me, that if theyre doing these runs, they can stand right infront of the mob and they wont see them. This is not the case for me whatsoever.

Does anybody have an idea, why mobs still see me? I am completely new to WoW, so keep in mind that very, very obvious stuff might have eluded me.

1583,The Shaman - based on WoW Classic account. Image of my baby Shaman. (Repost),"**The Shaman**

Three of them mulled about before me, rumbling and ambling without aim or goal.

Even prior to seeing them, on my journey through the scorched and sun-cracked soil, I could sense them; a confluence of primal anger, a disruption to the very sediment they consisted of.

The bluffs behind them thrust unimaginably high, roaring in to the open expanse above – as if wanting to cradle the clouds that sailed across listlessly, or offer respite to the creatures that passed by: from wyvern to gull, and even the sporadic Dwarf-mounted gryphon. I’d watch as they soared above silently, traversing our world in a way most cannot, until they’d escape from my vision by either passing over the bluff, or having their majestic silhouette swallowed by the glaring, unforgiving sun.

It humbled me, to be in the presence of such edifying nature. It always did. Feeling the order of all that is was natural to one of my calling, but though my very soul was attuned to the elements this world consisted of, it would still invoke awe to *see*what I otherwise felt coursing through me, spilling from me.

But these elementals… they gave me pause. A sense of dread uncoiled within, and began to slither around my very being. It was strange, to feel negative about nature – but perhaps the reason I took to it so strongly is*because* of my attunement? I tried to shake the ill thought away, and felt my mind wandering freely, mostly about how anyone else would react to such a sight. Would they feel the anger, the disturbance emanating so powerfully from them?

I’d met priests before. From those cultivated within my own tribe, to the poor damned forsaken, and tried in vain to understand their perspective, their calling. Would they be privy to wonders and anomalies of the world that I know not? Had I, on many an occasion, sauntered across the dry, torrid Barrens, or the cold, damp and dreary Silverpine Forest, bypassing matters of great interest simply because my mind could not reach out to them? Comprehend them on a level it required? The thought made me shudder, and so I tried to focus on the initial channel from which the it stemmed.

“The light,” they’d all assert, each using different words, methods and gods but preaching the same. “It flows through all of us whether we will it or not.”

El’jah, she was a stand in four our acting High Priestess, Zil’noba, when matters of importance – often attended by Warchief and Shamanistic idol, Thrall himself – would love to bring up this topic with the Shamans of the tribe, or near anyone who would listen. Be it in the midst of a welcome summer sun, or during some chaotic panic of a wild storm, buffeting us with rain and vigorous winds, she’d speak of her light with admiration.

“When you execute any action,” she would always say, “Something within you, a guided voice, an echoed authority, a silent sense of morality will always attach and element of righteousness to it – no matter where it falls on the spectrum.”

She’d hold her hand up, allowing the coarse cloth robe to shift down a little, revealing more of her mottled blue hue. Her eyes would glaze over for a couple of seconds, well versed in her holiness as she was, and I’d watch as her dry, cracked lips would flutter and push against her tusks – both of which were surprisingly maintained well.

The immediate area would spark in to luminescence, a brightness that was both immense and ethereal, infinitely welcoming and undoubtedly natural, albeit in a different sense. The glow would wash over everyone and everything nearby, transforming even the darkest, bare hut to a scene of beauty – the glimmer of a diamond in a sparse sea of coal. The light itself sung of a gold so rich no vein could boast its equal, mingled with a moon-limned silver that put all jewellery to shame.

“This is the manifestation of that very essence,” she’d say, knowing we were all captivated. “Pure, direct energy, given to us, through us, to mould and bend as we see fit.” She would bring a second hand to the first, and proceed to execute a complex dance in which all four fingers and both thumbs entwined, unravelled, hooked, stroked and broke apart – then threw her hands outward.

The light would reach its pinnacle, and a silky hum would ring in our ears – soothing and calming. The embrace of her divinity would wash over all present, and even those with trivial aches, and age-earned pains would feel infinitely better.

Often, I’d been called in to assist with restoring the hunters and scouts of the tribe, and I’d see Zil’noba, El’jah, or any of their followers guiding their holy healing at the boar-rent flesh or scorpid pierced torsos. And though my restorative prowess would ultimately yield the same results, I would watch nonetheless. As the light pulsed and waned, highlighting the wound with an intricate dexterity, before the flesh fused back together, repairing itself with nary a hint of a scar, I’d welcome the process with intrigue. The resulting groan of relief from the subject would pull a grin from each of us – shaman or priest alike.

After she would finish her tale and prayer of healing, the lesser priests would cheer, seeing their future within this beacon of respect, and, I must admit that even I would at times find myself taken by their words, their theatrics, and the sudden imbued comfort.

But, I always noticed one thing with all these priests I’d took to conversing with.

She, they, near every time, would omit the dichotomy.

When they spoke about healing, and virtue; gods and life she left out the more taboo subject. When her spell was at its peak, and the glow claimed precedence over all else, I could see that lurching behind every troll, every single one of us – cold and cast out – was our shadow. The reflection of us that we would never be free of. True, that dark companion was harmless in its own right, but its namesake had wedged its way between life and love over generations.

True, she was a conduit of the gods, or at least the gods our tribe followed, but so, too, was she susceptible to the very darkness that resides within all of us.

Rogues partner with shadow for stealth, trickery and to steal the advantage in combat, true. But they did not, could not, manipulate it. They used the natural shadow, and greeted it as an old friend. Priests, they are the very souls of balance between the two extreme ends of the spectrum. Daily, their minds are battlefields in which the war of light and darkness wages ceaselessly.

Our tribe knew this all too well. I’d heard stories of Zil’nobas predecessor, head of all priestly activities before I was conceived, before El’jah was of note, and how she veered, slowly and irrevocably from the path of clear virtuosity in to the murky, blurred annals of the shadow.

How, gradually, the tattered and quaint hut erected for the purposes of worship was soon collecting incongruous opulence, rare trinkets and balms, amassing articles of vast worth or trophies of legend – more than our tribe had ever held dominion of, or wanted to have dominion of. How within three moons, the canvassed walls had soon been adorned with luxurious furs, how her priestly robes had evolved from the practical itching fabric to fine silks filigreed with golden thread and bedecked with glimmering pearls. One could not glance around without their eyes taunted by immense value, even the foundations of the hut were not spared from such glamour; gleaming silver or gold links – encrusted with sapphires and rubies coiled around the buttressing wooden beams that held the structure up.

I’d heard many a time, how a wave of unease - perhaps the very sense of morality El’jah would preach - washed over the tribe and infected all of them, plague-like, until each of them felt a conscious sickness surging through them.

How they approached Zil’noba – few at first, until the worries became unbearable - fearing an audience with the High Priestess herself in their shrewd expectation that something ill was afoot.

How she disclosed to the group that she’d harboured fears, too, and decided to approach the tribe leader and express their concern. How the group of worried trolls were met with unearned anger and an icy steeliness, that when pressed, broke him in to a rabid rage. Some stories say he began frothing out the mouth, not quite able to complete the words of banishment and punishment he was hurling at all present. How he reached for his famed and fabled war axe – the champion of a thousand skirmishes, and the blade that won us our land – and began swinging with menace and madness, peculiarly lacking any of the skill he’d showed over time.

How he roared at their backs, watching them scramble over one another to escape, claiming any harbouring doubts about their High Priestess would be labelled as blasphemers, and the minds in which such thoughts existed could be removed freely and swiftly at his own hand.

How Zil’noba did the forbidden, when she received a blow mere moments after she enveloped herself in the mighty Power Word: Shield, feeling the strike bite in to the life essence protection her, and knowing that the axe would have severely crippled her. She granted herself vision in to the uncountable facets and myriad mysteries of our leader’s mind, only to find it dominated and commandeered – like a vulnerable vessel assimilated amidst a turbulent and shadowed sea. And the captain of the ship, the leader of the mutiny, was the High Priestess herself.

The battle that waged between the two priests has been a favourite tale to tell amongst the tribesfolk – sitting around a crackling fire, or diluted fire nova totem. Though, the storyteller always ensured to hit home with the sincerity behind it; it was a tale of wonder – with streams of shadow intended to flay the very mind, of sharp, scorching slashes of smiting light which burst the scene in to a fantastic vision – even when dripping with danger, of muttered Power Words of defence and taint, of maladies healed and foul shadow-borne afflictions cured amid the weeping cries of others, and the confused ramblings of the mind sick leader. But the moral of the story was the most powerful defence to future generations. Especially for the priesthood, in which it is an anecdote to muse on wholly – that the light within us all is susceptible to the hungering shadow we all attempt to extinguish. For those in the godly robes, it’s all the more dangerous.

Each time I thought about this, I would consider the position of the shaman. The call we heed is that of nature, and nature only. Druids accept the call of nature, too, but where they focus on life and the biology – in its independence or symbiosis - of all that breathe and grow, we focus on the sheer forces that exist. We do not bend a story to our will, or adhere to one specific sect of nature. Priests may claim their god, or gods are the mightiest and in such, they should be worshipped above another’s, but, I believe this is the folly of pride. We shaman do not have to argue or dissect the following of other shaman we meet, because we all serve the natural powers, the very concourse of Azeroth consists of.

We strip away the complexities and complications of all that is, and find ourselves as conductors for earth, water, air and fire.

True, we, too, have precarious elements within our numbers – literally and figuratively speaking. Oft, I’ve heard of stories in which my kin across the races have lost their temper, or control, and unleashed the intensity of lava itself on the unfortunate object of contention… but, the element in and of itself is innocent – ‘tis the conductor’s disposition and actions that wreak havoc, the element is of no fel malice or twisted control, but a mere tool.

Those filled with anger may manipulate the element to their uses, but believe in my words: No matter what form a flame-wielding demon or foe may take, from candle-tipped kobold to Ragnaros himself, the element is innocent and pure. Work to sleuth the intent and you’ll mine the corruption like a rotten pearl in a void-touched oyster.

Alas, I digress. Perhaps because I fret disclosing the length in which I sat, observing the anomalies before me, or perhaps because there is a modicum of relevance to the words I say.

Earth elementals they were, titanic and bulky beings. A crude, misshapen boulder sat atop, complete with enchanted glowing orbs for eyes. A monstrous mid-piece representing a torso, complete with a belt of floating rocks jutting out either side as arms. And finally, a motley collection of pebbles, stones, large rocks and small boulders beneath, which shuffled and clambered in an intriguing motion to achieve locomotion.

They would collide with one another, giving advent to a thunderous crash which made me wince in both anticipation prior, and sheer humbled fear after. The noise so deafening, I thought it a wonder that the bluffs crumbled not.

I sensed within the pureness, the bedrock of which they consisted, an element of rage, and wondered what – if anything – had caused such a furious unrest in a material that was renowned for sturdiness.

I deducted, after a time, that only the destruction of such unrest would acquiesce the earth’s anger – and besides, no element is truly destroyed, but simply form-changed or displaced. I was not about to banish these mighty oddities from existence, as Zil’noba did the former High Priestess, but more grant them peace, and admit their return back to the quintessential truth on which they tread – much like when the spark of our most precious life force dims from us, and we return as a welcome droplet in to the rippling pond of our ancestors.

I swallowed my trepidation and began to prepare for the battle. A shaman, as a traveller of the world has the means to call anywhere a home. We need not walls and safety, but four totems in which we meld the nature around us. And thus, I began.

My four totems were placed around me, equidistant from the last to give me pure affinity with the elements I would call on, those that I had communed with throughout my journey thus far.

First, I cast the benefit of Stone Skin on my earth totem, so as to grant my very flesh with the defensive strength of my foe.

Then, I called upon the searing flame to host my fire totem, in the hopes its vicious touch may crash damage at my behest and aid.

Within the air totem, I called upon the grace of air, to offer my body to the very winds that whipped over and caressed the plains behind me, and tugged at my hair and clothing. I hoped it would offer me the swiftness to dodge any incoming pummels from the boulders, and allow my two-handed axe, also coursing with the fury of wind, feel as light as a switch whilst achieving a true strike.

And finally, I imbued my water totem with the Healing Spring boon, so as to allow the very water that provides life and growth to flow through my veins, rejuvenating any damage I may be unfortunate enough to take.

And so, standing amongst the foundation of Azeroth, I engaged.

I took my stance, and began calling on the crackling force of lightning, feeling the vibrations and tickling as the brilliant blue orb formed, then I coursed it forward aiming for the elemental nearest. I’d hoped perhaps the others were too distracted in their madness to notice the advent of battle, but it seems they were not about to let their kin suffer combat alone. As the orb crashed in to its torso, it bouldered face turned to me, and I felt those orbs locking on to my form as it began hurling forward, flanked by the two others.

I called forward another bolt to lash out as it closed the distance, and when close enough, I summoned the burning passion within me to shock it with a touch of flame. The elemental groaned under the smarting blaze, and I could see the glowing effect of my fire, aware that my spell would ebb away at its life.

It was almost upon me now, with the two others not so far behind, and so I attempted one more lightning bolt. Before the spell had finished casting, the monstrosity was before me, towering to double my height and I braced myself, relying on my strengthened flesh, for the brutal blow I was about to receive.

*Thud*!

Should I not have opted for stoneskin, I fear that attack may have ended much worse. I had nothing but cloth and leather to protect me from whaterver the wilderness of Azeroth may throw at me, so the stoneskin was an ally and a necessity. Though the attack stole me of my focus, I finished the cast and threw it in the face of the attacker.

I unsheathed my two-handed axe, and swung it forward. The grace of air swam through me, and though the fury of the wind didn’t help with this particular attack, I felt it clear and powerful, strike hard. A crispness to the attack that didn’t exist when I was not battling with air on my side.

I could see the creature was visibly damaged now, but unfortunately its brothers were upon me. I took two strong blows that near crippled me, feeling a crack of bone and a pain like no other. Swiftly, I acted on initiative. I called back the stoneskin, perhaps a stupid move, but hardened flesh or not, I could not survive this battle.

In its stead, I threw down my Stoneclaw totem, and I watched as the peeling, penetrating sound and distracting glow emitting from the top attracted the two others, but I’d damaged the initial victim too much for it to turn its back on me. As his kin were occupied, I stayed his speed with the chill of my frost shock and limped away as fast as my beaten body would carry me. Each step a trial within itself, the grace of air may have been on my side, but each lungful was punishing spike of a thousand icy needles.

I made enough distance by my reckoning, and though my healing spring totem was working to fuse together the boulder-inflicted wounds, it was not enough. And so I conjured forward my restorative abilities speaking the words as fast as I could – and though this method demanded more of my focus and mana, it was quicker. I may have paid for convenience with my energy, but the alternative was my life.

I felt the water rush over me, soothing and perfect – a far cry from the welcoming hug of the priest’s light, but in my eyes, so much sweeter. The very water of life poured from my hands, and rejuvenated the bones – what was moments ago cracked and broken, was now repaired and strengthened.

The elemental swung for me once more, but I ducked feeling the action speed up by a zephyr of encouragement. I thanked the air for its assistance, and it seemed to appreciate it, because as I swung my axe once more, the velocity was like nothing I’ve ever witnessed outside of such fury. A gale of wind, focused purely behind my axe swept up a storm, making my attack uncomprehendingly fast, and then it changed direction – offering me a whistled push to bring my weapon back, and ready for another swing. It happened so fast, every time the fury of wind took over, and each time it surprised me. Another attack, just as strong as the last – a power that I alone could not ever hope to match. Another attack. Swift and seemingly of its own accord.

The monster’s life force was waning, it was sluggish and weak. It tried once more to lash out at me, and I dodged it easily. Though, behind its massive stature, I noticed the others had destroyed my totem, and even worse, in the exhaustless fascination of my windfury, I realised not that my fire totem and water totem had both felt my plea for them been answered justly.

I renewed them, placing them around me and jumping out the way of an attack, ensuring there was enough distance from the initial target and me until I readied my axe once more, and, when I knew I could strike a hit, I did so. I thought for sure that would have reduced it to rubble, but yet it powered forward, stubborn to its impending fate – or perhaps thinking that very thing about me. I backtracked, which was never a good idea, but my mana was running low, the numbers were working against me. Desperately, I threw forward the powerful earth shock, and to me glee, the creature froze in place, shook violently for a second before tumbling down to a bad memory and detritus.

Still, there were two more to face.

I admit I began panicking, and so I threw down my totem of earthbind, and tried to keep distance between the elementals and myself, cursing my stupidity in wanting to put them at ease. As I maintained the motion, seeing the very ground beneath them shake and warble in an attempt to slow their progression, I thought about potentially returning home. My hearthstone was still recharging, but I could astral recall. I toyed with the idea for what felt like an eternity but could have only been a few fleeting second of panic, before I decided against it. That was an expert level spell, and required concentration and focus for a prolonged time – I could not conjure such presence of mind whilst being pummelled by such foes.

And so, feeling a little more ready, and engaged once more. Again, I attacked, and received attacks, I dodged then lashed back, once or twice the windfury enchant would assist me and I would cause significant damage, but then I would have to retreat a few meters, slowing them down with frost shocks or earth binds as I went, in order to grant myself time to heal, and then return. I was exhausted, I was bruised – even with the healing – and I knew I was in danger.

But, to my surprise, on one such retreat, I saw the glow of my flame shock intensify, and one of the monstrosities crumbled without need of my axe.

And thus, it was one on one. I felt confident, adrenaline coursed through me on a level I imagine a rogue would feel matched. I roared, allowing the madness and thrill of battle to share my veins with the healing waters, and I began to berserk. My axe swing faster still, and I could feel the heat of my own fire pouring from the area of which I shocked the last doomed thing. I was swinging with ease, and attempting to dance around its attacks. The battle was all the world consisted of, no matter whether a mage, shaman or warrior – when the song of life and death is played, the melody of the universe quietens.

Though, perhaps in my rage, I didn’t quite realise the damage I’d taken, nor the expenditure of mana I’d recklessly committed in renewing my totems, healing myself, or shocking my enemy. I took a strong blow to the face, surprised by the fact I could still see – though I was pouring with blood. And though I could feel the healing spring clearing the blood away, desperately repairing the broken flesh, I knew one more attack would mean my death. The beserking had ceased, and as the madness left me, reality swam back in.

I tried to jump backward, but the creature dogged my every step. And I decided to risk a heal, but my energy had all bit dissipated. I couldn’t finish the spell even if I could remember the words. I stood, axe in hands, beaten and bruised, surrounded by wind, fire, water, and… earth. Too weak to fight, too exhausted to cast, I saw the the final blow that was about to steal me of my existence. Coming closer.

Closer.

Closer.

I closed my eyes, and grabbed hold of my last ankh and holding it tight, as my last resort, I began fusing my spirit to it, knowing that should I die now, my soul will return to live with my ancestors for eternity. That was not my calling, I had time left in which I needed to heal the world, and help people – from esoteric tribes to mighty cities. And so, in what would have been the last few seconds of life, I transferred my soul in to the relic and allowed the final blow.

Within the spiritual home of the ankh, I felt my physical form crumple to the ground and felt the elemental pause for a moment, before the rumbling family of stones that granted it movement began to fade, sound and vibrations both, in to the distance.

When I knew the time was right, I urged my life force seep out of the ankh, and return in to the body – fitting in to it like well-worn armour. I was broken, I was defeated, but what was just moments ago my lifeless form, stood up. I took a moment to sit, and eat, allowing myself to regain my energy, and scan my body for exactly what was wrong. Numbness, gaping wounds, broken collar bone and ribs, dislocated shoulder – a myriad little tales that spoke of combat. Then, I got to restoring them.

I was shaken, truly. But I was not gone.

I watched as the elemental that just killed me retook its senseless place in the world, and began ambling once more, seemingly without aim. Hiding the menace and danger within its enchanted, sturdy veneer.

Now I was fully healed, and it was alone – I knew the battle would be easier.

I called my totems once more, reading to engage in the same manner I defeated the first, lightning bolt, flame and axe. But, before my very eyes, the earth began to churn, shake and violently lurch about until, as if giving birth, a new elemental joined the other.

I was vexed, and humbled. What was this magic? I’d never seen anything of the like before – perhaps it was better to disengage completely, approach shaman over higher learning, or perhaps even Thrall himself – this would surely be a matter of little challenge to him.

As I mulled over the phenomenon, I felt something eerie and unsettling pull at my comfort, conjuring an army of goose prickles about my flesh, and making my hair stand up on end. I spun behind, wondering if some predator had been watching me with the same intention of me watching these enemies.

And what did I find?

An undead. Female. Decked in robes, armed with a large staff topped by a cerulean, pointed jewel. But worse, her entire form was consumed by shadow.

I waited for a few moments, watching as she approached – speechless. I spoke earlier of the taboo of shadow in my tribe and its ability to consume us entirely, and yet, I see a member of our precarious allied race, the Forsaken, approaching me wreathed in a nimbus of the essence.

Peculiarly, she waved at me. Then bowed. I was nonplussed - an entity coursing with my fear manifest, and there she stood, offering pleasantries.

“Hello,” she said cheerfully, in the common tongue. Her voice was cracked and raspy, which is where I noticed the mottled flesh around the windpipe had been eviscerated beyond repair. Neither Shaman, Paladin, Druid or Priest could tend to such a foul infliction; that was the power of evil mains beyond my understanding.

I nodded my head in stunned reply.

“I was going to come and resurrect you,” she added, when she realised I wasn’t going to respond.

I held out the exhausted trinket, showing her the ankh up close. “I used this,” I disclosed.

She smiled, and then stood beside me – a tiny thing, reeking of death and evil, but seemingly helpful and pleasant. I was confused beyond all measures.

She threw her hand out suddenly, causing me to flinch – but instead, I felt *fantastic*. A new lease for life, stronger – a powerful boon to my very fortitude. And once more, another silent spell, and I felt braver than I ever had, recklessly so, as if fear was but a memory I was struggled with.

“Need help?” she asked, casually.

I nodded, and thus we agreed to group up.

Somehow, in our interaction, the ground and spewed forth a third elemental, but it mattered not. I threw up my four totems, I felt a barrier of life energy surround my very body, I renewed the fury of wind on my axe, and side by side with one of the very energies I’ve dreaded may once again be the ruin of my tribe, I engaged in battle – calming the anomaly with my affinity of nature, and my ally of shadow.

I know it’s not in the register a Troll would speak in, but that would be a minefield I don’t want to traverse just yet!

This was written over a few lunch breaks at work, so it may be lacking a flow I'd usually aim for. It's also been amped up quite a lot with RP of character and whatnot. You can probably tell the chunks I wrote whilst tired (such as the super rushed introduction of the Shadow Priest, but, caveats aside, I hope this brought a smile to some faces!

If it's well received, I'll happily write more - either for the Shaman or other classes. Or even feel free to request: ""I'd like a story about a Paladin's point of view of healing Shadowfang Keep."" Etc. Etc. I'll write whenever I have time.

If any would like to copy and paste this elsewhere, feel free too. Just please reference this post or message me directly for personal details. I write for a hobby and look for any and all commissions! So, all recognition is welcome!

Three of them mulled about before me, rumbling and ambling without aim or goal.

Even prior to seeing them, on my journey through the scorched and sun-cracked soil, I could sense them; a confluence of primal anger, a disruption to the very sediment they consisted of.

The bluffs behind them thrust unimaginably high, roaring in to the open expanse above – as if wanting to cradle the clouds that sailed across listlessly, or offer respite to the creatures that passed by: from wyvern to gull, and even the sporadic Dwarf-mounted gryphon. I’d watch as they soared above silently, traversing our world in a way most cannot, until they’d escape from my vision by either passing over the bluff, or having their majestic silhouette swallowed by the glaring, unforgiving sun.

It humbled me, to be in the presence of such edifying nature. It always did. Feeling the order of all that is was natural to one of my calling, but though my very soul was attuned to the elements this world consisted of, it would still invoke awe to *see*what I otherwise felt coursing through me, spilling from me.

But these elementals… they gave me pause. A sense of dread uncoiled within, and began to slither around my very being. It was strange, to feel negative about nature – but perhaps the reason I took to it so strongly is*because* of my attunement? I tried to shake the ill thought away, and felt my mind wandering freely, mostly about how anyone else would react to such a sight. Would they feel the anger, the disturbance emanating so powerfully from them?

I’d met priests before. From those cultivated within my own tribe, to the poor damned forsaken, and tried in vain to understand their perspective, their calling. Would they be privy to wonders and anomalies of the world that I know not? Had I, on many an occasion, sauntered across the dry, torrid Barrens, or the cold, damp and dreary Silverpine Forest, bypassing matters of great interest simply because my mind could not reach out to them? Comprehend them on a level it required? The thought made me shudder, and so I tried to focus on the initial channel from which the it stemmed.

“The light,” they’d all assert, each using different words, methods and gods but preaching the same. “It flows through all of us whether we will it or not.”

El’jah, she was a stand in four our acting High Priestess, Zil’noba, when matters of importance – often attended by Warchief and Shamanistic idol, Thrall himself – would love to bring up this topic with the Shamans of the tribe, or near anyone who would listen. Be it in the midst of a welcome summer sun, or during some chaotic panic of a wild storm, buffeting us with rain and vigorous winds, she’d speak of her light with admiration.

“When you execute any action,” she would always say, “Something within you, a guided voice, an echoed authority, a silent sense of morality will always attach and element of righteousness to it – no matter where it falls on the spectrum.”

She’d hold her hand up, allowing the coarse cloth robe to shift down a little, revealing more of her mottled blue hue. Her eyes would glaze over for a couple of seconds, well versed in her holiness as she was, and I’d watch as her dry, cracked lips would flutter and push against her tusks – both of which were surprisingly maintained well.

The immediate area would spark in to luminescence, a brightness that was both immense and ethereal, infinitely welcoming and undoubtedly natural, albeit in a different sense. The glow would wash over everyone and everything nearby, transforming even the darkest, bare hut to a scene of beauty – the glimmer of a diamond in a sparse sea of coal. The light itself sung of a gold so rich no vein could boast its equal, mingled with a moon-limned silver that put all jewellery to shame.

“This is the manifestation of that very essence,” she’d say, knowing we were all captivated. “Pure, direct energy, given to us, through us, to mould and bend as we see fit.” She would bring a second hand to the first, and proceed to execute a complex dance in which all four fingers and both thumbs entwined, unravelled, hooked, stroked and broke apart – then threw her hands outward.

The light would reach its pinnacle, and a silky hum would ring in our ears – soothing and calming. The embrace of her divinity would wash over all present, and even those with trivial aches, and age-earned pains would feel infinitely better.

Often, I’d been called in to assist with restoring the hunters and scouts of the tribe, and I’d see Zil’noba, El’jah, or any of their followers guiding their holy healing at the boar-rent flesh or scorpid pierced torsos. And though my restorative prowess would ultimately yield the same results, I would watch nonetheless. As the light pulsed and waned, highlighting the wound with an intricate dexterity, before the flesh fused back together, repairing itself with nary a hint of a scar, I’d welcome the process with intrigue. The resulting groan of relief from the subject would pull a grin from each of us – shaman or priest alike.

After she would finish her tale and prayer of healing, the lesser priests would cheer, seeing their future within this beacon of respect, and, I must admit that even I would at times find myself taken by their words, their theatrics, and the sudden imbued comfort.

One could not glance around without their eyes taunted by immense value, even the foundations of the hut were not spared from such glamour; gleaming silver or gold links – encrusted with sapphires and rubies coiled around the buttressing wooden beams that held the structure up.

I’d heard many a time, how a wave of unease - perhaps the very sense of morality El’jah would preach - washed over the tribe and infected all of them, plague-like, until each of them felt a conscious sickness surging through them.

Some stories say he began frothing out the mouth, not quite able to complete the words of banishment and punishment he was hurling at all present. How he reached for his famed and fabled war axe – the champion of a thousand skirmishes, and the blade that won us our land – and began swinging with menace and madness, peculiarly lacking any of the skill he’d showed over time.

How he roared at their backs, watching them scramble over one another to escape, claiming any harbouring doubts about their High Priestess would be labelled as blasphemers, and the minds in which such thoughts existed could be removed freely and swiftly at his own hand.

How Zil’noba did the forbidden, when she received a blow mere moments after she enveloped herself in the mighty Power Word: Shield, feeling the strike bite in to the life essence protection her, and knowing that the axe would have severely crippled her. She granted herself vision in to the uncountable facets and myriad mysteries of our leader’s mind, only to find it dominated and commandeered – like a vulnerable vessel assimilated amidst a turbulent and shadowed sea. And the captain of the ship, the leader of the mutiny, was the High Priestess herself.

The battle that waged between the two priests has been a favourite tale to tell amongst the tribesfolk – sitting around a crackling fire, or diluted fire nova totem. Though, the storyteller always ensured to hit home with the sincerity behind it; it was a tale of wonder – with streams of shadow intended to flay the very mind, of sharp, scorching slashes of smiting light which burst the scene in to a fantastic vision – even when dripping with danger, of muttered Power Words of defence and taint, of maladies healed and foul shadow-borne afflictions cured amid the weeping cries of others, and the confused ramblings of the mind sick leader. But the moral of the story was the most powerful defence to future generations. Especially for the priesthood, in which it is an anecdote to muse on wholly – that the light within us all is susceptible to the hungering shadow we all attempt to extinguish. For those in the godly robes, it’s all the more dangerous.

Each time I thought about this, I would consider the position of the shaman. The call we heed is that of nature, and nature only. Druids accept the call of nature, too, but where they focus on life and the biology – in its independence or symbiosis - of all that breathe and grow, we focus on the sheer forces that exist. We do not bend a story to our will, or adhere to one specific sect of nature. Priests may claim their god, or gods are the mightiest and in such, they should be worshipped above another’s, but, I believe this is the folly of pride. We shaman do not have to argue or dissect the following of other shaman we meet, because we all serve the natural powers, the very concourse of Azeroth consists of.

We strip away the complexities and complications of all that is, and find ourselves as conductors for earth, water, air and fire.

True, we, too, have precarious elements within our numbers – literally and figuratively speaking. Oft, I’ve heard of stories in which my kin across the races have lost their temper, or control, and unleashed the intensity of lava itself on the unfortunate object of contention… but, the element in and of itself is innocent – ‘tis the conductor’s disposition and actions that wreak havoc, the element is of no fel malice or twisted control, but a mere tool.

Those filled with anger may manipulate the element to their uses, but believe in my words: No matter what form a flame-wielding demon or foe may take, from candle-tipped kobold to Ragnaros himself, the element is innocent and pure. Work to sleuth the intent and you’ll mine the corruption like a rotten pearl in a void-touched oyster.

Alas, I digress. Perhaps because I fret disclosing the length in which I sat, observing the anomalies before me, or perhaps because there is a modicum of relevance to the words I say.

Earth elementals they were, titanic and bulky beings. A crude, misshapen boulder sat atop, complete with enchanted glowing orbs for eyes. A monstrous mid-piece representing a torso, complete with a belt of floating rocks jutting out either side as arms. And finally, a motley collection of pebbles, stones, large rocks and small boulders beneath, which shuffled and clambered in an intriguing motion to achieve locomotion.

They would collide with one another, giving advent to a thunderous crash which made me wince in both anticipation prior, and sheer humbled fear after. The noise so deafening, I thought it a wonder that the bluffs crumbled not.

I sensed within the pureness, the bedrock of which they consisted, an element of rage, and wondered what – if anything – had caused such a furious unrest in a material that was renowned for sturdiness.

I deducted, after a time, that only the destruction of such unrest would acquiesce the earth’s anger – and besides, no element is truly destroyed, but simply form-changed or displaced. I was not about to banish these mighty oddities from existence, as Zil’noba did the former High Priestess, but more grant them peace, and admit their return back to the quintessential truth on which they tread – much like when the spark of our most precious life force dims from us, and we return as a welcome droplet in to the rippling pond of our ancestors.

I swallowed my trepidation and began to prepare for the battle. A shaman, as a traveller of the world has the means to call anywhere a home. We need not walls and safety, but four totems in which we meld the nature around us. And thus, I began.

My four totems were placed around me, equidistant from the last to give me pure affinity with the elements I would call on, those that I had communed with throughout my journey thus far.

First, I cast the benefit of Stone Skin on my earth totem, so as to grant my very flesh with the defensive strength of my foe.

Then, I called upon the searing flame to host my fire totem, in the hopes its vicious touch may crash damage at my behest and aid.

Within the air totem, I called upon the grace of air, to offer my body to the very winds that whipped over and caressed the plains behind me, and tugged at my hair and clothing. I hoped it would offer me the swiftness to dodge any incoming pummels from the boulders, and allow my two-handed axe, also coursing with the fury of wind, feel as light as a switch whilst achieving a true strike.

And finally, I imbued my water totem with the Healing Spring boon, so as to allow the very water that provides life and growth to flow through my veins, rejuvenating any damage I may be unfortunate enough to take.

And so, standing amongst the foundation of Azeroth, I engaged.

I took my stance, and began calling on the crackling force of lightning, feeling the vibrations and tickling as the brilliant blue orb formed, then I coursed it forward aiming for the elemental nearest. I’d hoped perhaps the others were too distracted in their madness to notice the advent of battle, but it seems they were not about to let their kin suffer combat alone. As the orb crashed in to its torso, it bouldered face turned to me, and I felt those orbs locking on to my form as it began hurling forward, flanked by the two others.

I called forward another bolt to lash out as it closed the distance, and when close enough, I summoned the burning passion within me to shock it with a touch of flame. The elemental groaned under the smarting blaze, and I could see the glowing effect of my fire, aware that my spell would ebb away at its life.

It was almost upon me now, with the two others not so far behind, and so I attempted one more lightning bolt. Before the spell had finished casting, the monstrosity was before me, towering to double my height and I braced myself, relying on my strengthened flesh, for the brutal blow I was about to receive.

*Thud*!

Should I not have opted for stoneskin, I fear that attack may have ended much worse. I had nothing but cloth and leather to protect me from whaterver the wilderness of Azeroth may throw at me, so the stoneskin was an ally and a necessity. Though the attack stole me of my focus, I finished the cast and threw it in the face of the attacker.

I unsheathed my two-handed axe, and swung it forward. The grace of air swam through me, and though the fury of the wind didn’t help with this particular attack, I felt it clear and powerful, strike hard. A crispness to the attack that didn’t exist when I was not battling with air on my side.

I could see the creature was visibly damaged now, but unfortunately its brothers were upon me. I took two strong blows that near crippled me, feeling a crack of bone and a pain like no other. Swiftly, I acted on initiative. I called back the stoneskin, perhaps a stupid move, but hardened flesh or not, I could not survive this battle.

In its stead, I threw down my Stoneclaw totem, and I watched as the peeling, penetrating sound and distracting glow emitting from the top attracted the two others, but I’d damaged the initial victim too much for it to turn its back on me. As his kin were occupied, I stayed his speed with the chill of my frost shock and limped away as fast as my beaten body would carry me. Each step a trial within itself, the grace of air may have been on my side, but each lungful was punishing spike of a thousand icy needles.

I made enough distance by my reckoning, and though my healing spring totem was working to fuse together the boulder-inflicted wounds, it was not enough. And so I conjured forward my restorative abilities speaking the words as fast as I could – and though this method demanded more of my focus and mana, it was quicker. I may have paid for convenience with my energy, but the alternative was my life.

I felt the water rush over me, soothing and perfect – a far cry from the welcoming hug of the priest’s light, but in my eyes, so much sweeter. The very water of life poured from my hands, and rejuvenated the bones – what was moments ago cracked and broken, was now repaired and strengthened.

The elemental swung for me once more, but I ducked feeling the action speed up by a zephyr of encouragement. I thanked the air for its assistance, and it seemed to appreciate it, because as I swung my axe once more, the velocity was like nothing I’ve ever witnessed outside of such fury. A gale of wind, focused purely behind my axe swept up a storm, making my attack uncomprehendingly fast, and then it changed direction – offering me a whistled push to bring my weapon back, and ready for another swing. It happened so fast, every time the fury of wind took over, and each time it surprised me. Another attack, just as strong as the last – a power that I alone could not ever hope to match. Another attack. Swift and seemingly of its own accord.

The monster’s life force was waning, it was sluggish and weak. It tried once more to lash out at me, and I dodged it easily. Though, behind its massive stature, I noticed the others had destroyed my totem, and even worse, in the exhaustless fascination of my windfury, I realised not that my fire totem and water totem had both felt my plea for them been answered justly.

I renewed them, placing them around me and jumping out the way of an attack, ensuring there was enough distance from the initial target and me until I readied my axe once more, and, when I knew I could strike a hit, I did so. I thought for sure that would have reduced it to rubble, but yet it powered forward, stubborn to its impending fate – or perhaps thinking that very thing about me. I backtracked, which was never a good idea, but my mana was running low, the numbers were working against me. Desperately, I threw forward the powerful earth shock, and to me glee, the creature froze in place, shook violently for a second before tumbling down to a bad memory and detritus.

Still, there were two more to face.

I admit I began panicking, and so I threw down my totem of earthbind, and tried to keep distance between the elementals and myself, cursing my stupidity in wanting to put them at ease. As I maintained the motion, seeing the very ground beneath them shake and warble in an attempt to slow their progression, I thought about potentially returning home. My hearthstone was still recharging, but I could astral recall. I toyed with the idea for what felt like an eternity but could have only been a few fleeting second of panic, before I decided against it. That was an expert level spell, and required concentration and focus for a prolonged time – I could not conjure such presence of mind whilst being pummelled by such foes.

And so, feeling a little more ready, and engaged once more. Again, I attacked, and received attacks, I dodged then lashed back, once or twice the windfury enchant would assist me and I would cause significant damage, but then I would have to retreat a few meters, slowing them down with frost shocks or earth binds as I went, in order to grant myself time to heal, and then return. I was exhausted, I was bruised – even with the healing – and I knew I was in danger.

But, to my surprise, on one such retreat, I saw the glow of my flame shock intensify, and one of the monstrosities crumbled without need of my axe.

And thus, it was one on one. I felt confident, adrenaline coursed through me on a level I imagine a rogue would feel matched. I roared, allowing the madness and thrill of battle to share my veins with the healing waters, and I began to berserk. My axe swing faster still, and I could feel the heat of my own fire pouring from the area of which I shocked the last doomed thing. I was swinging with ease, and attempting to dance around its attacks. The battle was all the world consisted of, no matter whether a mage, shaman or warrior – when the song of life and death is played, the melody of the universe quietens.

Though, perhaps in my rage, I didn’t quite realise the damage I’d taken, nor the expenditure of mana I’d recklessly committed in renewing my totems, healing myself, or shocking my enemy. I took a strong blow to the face, surprised by the fact I could still see – though I was pouring with blood. And though I could feel the healing spring clearing the blood away, desperately repairing the broken flesh, I knew one more attack would mean my death. The beserking had ceased, and as the madness left me, reality swam back in.

I tried to jump backward, but the creature dogged my every step. And I decided to risk a heal, but my energy had all bit dissipated. I couldn’t finish the spell even if I could remember the words. I stood, axe in hands, beaten and bruised, surrounded by wind, fire, water, and… earth. Too weak to fight, too exhausted to cast, I saw the the final blow that was about to steal me of my existence. Coming closer.

Closer.

Closer.

I closed my eyes, and grabbed hold of my last ankh and holding it tight, as my last resort, I began fusing my spirit to it, knowing that should I die now, my soul will return to live with my ancestors for eternity. That was not my calling, I had time left in which I needed to heal the world, and help people – from esoteric tribes to mighty cities. And so, in what would have been the last few seconds of life, I transferred my soul in to the relic and allowed the final blow.

Within the spiritual home of the ankh, I felt my physical form crumple to the ground and felt the elemental pause for a moment, before the rumbling family of stones that granted it movement began to fade, sound and vibrations both, in to the distance.

When I knew the time was right, I urged my life force seep out of the ankh, and return in to the body – fitting in to it like well-worn armour. I was broken, I was defeated, but what was just moments ago my lifeless form, stood up. I took a moment to sit, and eat, allowing myself to regain my energy, and scan my body for exactly what was wrong. Numbness, gaping wounds, broken collar bone and ribs, dislocated shoulder – a myriad little tales that spoke of combat. Then, I got to restoring them.

I was shaken, truly. But I was not gone.

I watched as the elemental that just killed me retook its senseless place in the world, and began ambling once more, seemingly without aim. Hiding the menace and danger within its enchanted, sturdy veneer.

Now I was fully healed, and it was alone – I knew the battle would be easier.

I called my totems once more, reading to engage in the same manner I defeated the first, lightning bolt, flame and axe. But, before my very eyes, the earth began to churn, shake and violently lurch about until, as if giving birth, a new elemental joined the other.

I was vexed, and humbled. What was this magic? I’d never seen anything of the like before – perhaps it was better to disengage completely, approach shaman over higher learning, or perhaps even Thrall himself – this would surely be a matter of little challenge to him.

As I mulled over the phenomenon, I felt something eerie and unsettling pull at my comfort, conjuring an army of goose prickles about my flesh, and making my hair stand up on end. I spun behind, wondering if some predator had been watching me with the same intention of me watching these enemies.

And what did I find?

An undead. Female. Decked in robes, armed with a large staff topped by a cerulean, pointed jewel. But worse, her entire form was consumed by shadow.

I waited for a few moments, watching as she approached – speechless. I spoke earlier of the taboo of shadow in my tribe and its ability to consume us entirely, and yet, I see a member of our precarious allied race, the Forsaken, approaching me wreathed in a nimbus of the essence.

Peculiarly, she waved at me. Then bowed. I was nonplussed - an entity coursing with my fear manifest, and there she stood, offering pleasantries.

“Hello,” she said cheerfully, in the common tongue. Her voice was cracked and raspy, which is where I noticed the mottled flesh around the windpipe had been eviscerated beyond repair. Neither Shaman, Paladin, Druid or Priest could tend to such a foul infliction; that was the power of evil mains beyond my understanding.

I nodded my head in stunned reply.

“I was going to come and resurrect you,” she added, when she realised I wasn’t going to respond.

I held out the exhausted trinket, showing her the ankh up close. “I used this,” I disclosed.

She smiled, and then stood beside me – a tiny thing, reeking of death and evil, but seemingly helpful and pleasant. I was confused beyond all measures.

She threw her hand out suddenly, causing me to flinch – but instead, I felt *fantastic*. A new lease for life, stronger – a powerful boon to my very fortitude. And once more, another silent spell, and I felt braver than I ever had, recklessly so, as if fear was but a memory I was struggled with.

“Need help?” she asked, casually.

I nodded, and thus we agreed to group up.

Somehow, in our interaction, the ground and spewed forth a third elemental, but it mattered not. I threw up my four totems, I felt a barrier of life energy surround my very body, I renewed the fury of wind on my axe, and side by side with one of the very energies I’ve dreaded may once again be the ruin of my tribe, I engaged in battle – calming the anomaly with my affinity of nature, and my ally of shadow.

This was written over a few lunch breaks at work, so it may be lacking a flow I'd usually aim for. It's also been amped up quite a lot with RP of character and whatnot. You can probably tell the chunks I wrote whilst tired (such as the super rushed introduction of the Shadow Priest, but, caveats aside, I hope this brought a smile to some faces!

If it's well received, I'll happily write more - either for the Shaman or other classes. Or even feel free to request: ""I'd like a story about a Paladin's point of view of healing Shadowfang Keep."" Etc. Etc. I'll write whenever I have time.

If any would like to copy and paste this elsewhere, feel free too. Just please reference this post or message me directly for personal details.

1584,GUIDE - How to get your mount at lvl 40,"Hey everyone!

So I just dinged lvl 40, and while I was at literallt 0.01% EXP i went and bought my mount right away.

As many other people I was wondering how to get enough money to get my mount right at lvl 40, I bearly had 40g on lvl 35.

[Here is the ling to place I farmed, it's in badlands](https://imgur.com/8LdEvY6). On the photo you can see two paths, grey and blue one. I went there at level 37 and farmed RIDGE HUNTRESS. From them you vendor everything BUT Tiger meat that drop. On my server a stack of Tiger meat goes for 55silver each, in one hour of farming them I went off with around 6-8 gold. You will benefit greatly if you have skinning since those mobs drop Thick Leather which sells (again, on my server) for 1.3g stack. You will occasionally get a green drop, if its good enough, AH it, if not, just vendor.

The blue farm is where I went at around 38.5 lvl and farmed ROCK ELEMENTALS. This farm is very lucrative, since you vendor everything that drops BUT you AH the Elemental Earth, on my server stack of 10 goes for 3.4 gold.

I after around 3 days of farming those two mobs i had enough gold to buy my mount stright away, and had 20g to spare.

I'm a Priest, so if you're a mage or hunter killing the mobs will be faster, for me it took 20 seconds on avg. to kill one mob.

The area isnt really populated. Only once i had to share the Elemental spot, but no one ever came to kill Huntresses.

If you have any questions feel free to ask!

Best of luck farming!

1604,Hello! Does anyone know how to make add ons for Classic WoW? I need help. :/," 

I wanna make an add on that is for tracking character achievements, the add on can be as simple or sophisticated as you can make it, I have all the achievements all listed down so either I need someone here to make a templet for the achievements and if possible I would like the add on to track the character's progress on the achievements if that is not possible that is okay, having the player just check off the ones they completed as they go on their adventures that works too, I would also like it if there was a feature to see other people's achievements who also have the add on.

(If you do not know how to make an add on but know where I can learn (youtube video please) were to make one with a simple explanation please share the video)

Thanks for all your help and I hope you all have a great rest of your day and enjoy the add on when it comes out (:",1570903786.0,"Hello! Does anyone know how to make add ons for Classic WoW? I need help. :/

1662,The Shaman - Story based on an interaction in Classic WoW! (Any artists willing to collab on a chill/cute series?),"**The Shaman**

Three of them mulled about before me, rumbling and ambling without aim or goal.

Even prior to seeing them, on my journey through the scorched and sun-cracked soil, I could sense them; a confluence of primal anger, a disruption to the very sediment they consisted of.

The bluffs behind them thrust unimaginably high, roaring in to the open expanse above – as if wanting to cradle the clouds that sailed across listlessly, or offer respite to the creatures that passed by: from wyvern to gull, and even the sporadic Dwarf-mounted gryphon. I’d watch as they soared above silently, traversing our world in a way most cannot, until they’d escape from my vision by either passing over the bluff, or having their majestic silhouette swallowed by the glaring, unforgiving sun.

It humbled me, to be in the presence of such edifying nature. It always did. Feeling the order of all that is was natural to one of my calling, but though my very soul was attuned to the elements this world consisted of, it would still invoke awe to *see*what I otherwise felt coursing through me, spilling from me.

But these elementals… they gave me pause. A sense of dread uncoiled within, and began to slither around my very being. It was strange, to feel negative about nature – but perhaps the reason I took to it so strongly is*because* of my attunement? I tried to shake the ill thought away, and felt my mind wandering freely, mostly about how anyone else would react to such a sight. Would they feel the anger, the disturbance emanating so powerfully from them?

I’d met priests before. From those cultivated within my own tribe, to the poor damned forsaken, and tried in vain to understand their perspective, their calling. Would they be privy to wonders and anomalies of the world that I know not? Had I, on many an occasion, sauntered across the dry, torrid Barrens, or the cold, damp and dreary Silverpine Forest, bypassing matters of great interest simply because my mind could not reach out to them? Comprehend them on a level it required? The thought made me shudder, and so I tried to focus on the initial channel from which the it stemmed.

“The light,” they’d all assert, each using different words, methods and gods but preaching the same. “It flows through all of us whether we will it or not.”

El’jah, she was a stand in four our acting High Priestess, Zil’noba, when matters of importance – often attended by Warchief and Shamanistic idol, Thrall himself – would love to bring up this topic with the Shamans of the tribe, or near anyone who would listen. Be it in the midst of a welcome summer sun, or during some chaotic panic of a wild storm, buffeting us with rain and vigorous winds, she’d speak of her light with admiration.

“When you execute any action,” she would always say, “Something within you, a guided voice, an echoed authority, a silent sense of morality will always attach and element of righteousness to it – no matter where it falls on the spectrum.”

She’d hold her hand up, allowing the coarse cloth robe to shift down a little, revealing more of her mottled blue hue. Her eyes would glaze over for a couple of seconds, well versed in her holiness as she was, and I’d watch as her dry, cracked lips would flutter and push against her tusks – both of which were surprisingly maintained well.

The immediate area would spark in to luminescence, a brightness that was both immense and ethereal, infinitely welcoming and undoubtedly natural, albeit in a different sense. The glow would wash over everyone and everything nearby, transforming even the darkest, bare hut to a scene of beauty – the glimmer of a diamond in a sparse sea of coal. The light itself sung of a gold so rich no vein could boast its equal, mingled with a moon-limned silver that put all jewellery to shame.

“This is the manifestation of that very essence,” she’d say, knowing we were all captivated. “Pure, direct energy, given to us, through us, to mould and bend as we see fit.” She would bring a second hand to the first, and proceed to execute a complex dance in which all four fingers and both thumbs entwined, unravelled, hooked, stroked and broke apart – then threw her hands outward.

The light would reach its pinnacle, and a silky hum would ring in our ears – soothing and calming. The embrace of her divinity would wash over all present, and even those with trivial aches, and age-earned pains would feel infinitely better. 

Often, I’d been called in to assist with restoring the hunters and scouts of the tribe, and I’d see Zil’noba, El’jah, or any of their followers guiding their holy healing at the boar-rent flesh or scorpid pierced torsos. And though my restorative prowess would ultimately yield the same results, I would watch nonetheless. As the light pulsed and waned, highlighting the wound with an intricate dexterity, before the flesh fused back together, repairing itself with nary a hint of a scar, I’d welcome the process with intrigue. The resulting groan of relief from the subject would pull a grin from each of us – shaman or priest alike.

After she would finish her tale and prayer of healing, the lesser priests would cheer, seeing their future within this beacon of respect, and, I must admit that even I would at times find myself taken by their words, their theatrics, and the sudden imbued comfort.

But, I always noticed one thing with all these priests I’d took to conversing with.

She, they, near every time, would omit the dichotomy.

When they spoke about healing, and virtue; gods and life she left out the more taboo subject. When her spell was at its peak, and the glow claimed precedence over all else, I could see that lurching behind every troll, every single one of us – cold and cast out – was our shadow. The reflection of us that we would never be free of. True, that dark companion was harmless in its own right, but its namesake had wedged its way between life and love over generations.

True, she was a conduit of the gods, or at least the gods our tribe followed, but so, too, was she susceptible to the very darkness that resides within all of us.

Rogues partner with shadow for stealth, trickery and to steal the advantage in combat, true. But they did not, could not, manipulate it. They used the natural shadow, and greeted it as an old friend. Priests, they are the very souls of balance between the two extreme ends of the spectrum. Daily, their minds are battlefields in which the war of light and darkness wages ceaselessly.

Our tribe knew this all too well. I’d heard stories of Zil’nobas predecessor, head of all priestly activities before I was conceived, before El’jah was of note, and how she veered, slowly and irrevocably from the path of clear virtuosity in to the murky, blurred annals of the shadow.

How, gradually, the tattered and quaint hut erected for the purposes of worship was soon collecting incongruous opulence, rare trinkets and balms, amassing articles of vast worth or trophies of legend – more than our tribe had ever held dominion of, or wanted to have dominion of. How within three moons, the canvassed walls had soon been adorned with luxurious furs, how her priestly robes had evolved from the practical itching fabric to fine silks filigreed with golden thread and bedecked with glimmering pearls. One could not glance around without their eyes taunted by immense value, even the foundations of the hut were not spared from such glamour; gleaming silver or gold links – encrusted with sapphires and rubies coiled around the buttressing wooden beams that held the structure up.

I’d heard many a time, how a wave of unease - perhaps the very sense of morality El’jah would preach - washed over the tribe and infected all of them, plague-like, until each of them felt a conscious sickness surging through them. 

How they approached Zil’noba – few at first, until the worries became unbearable - fearing an audience with the High Priestess herself in their shrewd expectation that something ill was afoot.

How she disclosed to the group that she’d harboured fears, too, and decided to approach the tribe leader and express their concern. How the group of worried trolls were met with unearned anger and an icy steeliness, that when pressed, broke him in to a rabid rage. Some stories say he began frothing out the mouth, not quite able to complete the words of banishment and punishment he was hurling at all present. How he reached for his famed and fabled war axe – the champion of a thousand skirmishes, and the blade that won us our land – and began swinging with menace and madness, peculiarly lacking any of the skill he’d showed over time.

How he roared at their backs, watching them scramble over one another to escape, claiming any harbouring doubts about their High Priestess would be labelled as blasphemers, and the minds in which such thoughts existed could be removed freely and swiftly at his own hand.

How Zil’noba did the forbidden, when she received a blow mere moments after she enveloped herself in the mighty Power Word: Shield, feeling the strike bite in to the life essence protection her, and knowing that the axe would have severely crippled her. She granted herself vision in to the uncountable facets and myriad mysteries of our leader’s mind, only to find it dominated and commandeered – like a vulnerable vessel assimilated amidst a turbulent and shadowed sea. And the captain of the ship, the leader of the mutiny, was the High Priestess herself.

The battle that waged between the two priests has been a favourite tale to tell amongst the tribesfolk – sitting around a crackling fire, or diluted fire nova totem. Though, the storyteller always ensured to hit home with the sincerity behind it; it was a tale of wonder – with streams of shadow intended to flay the very mind, of sharp, scorching slashes of smiting light which burst the scene in to a fantastic vision – even when dripping with danger, of muttered Power Words of defence and taint, of maladies healed and foul shadow-borne afflictions cured amid the weeping cries of others, and the confused ramblings of the mind sick leader. But the moral of the story was the most powerful defence to future generations. Especially for the priesthood, in which it is an anecdote to muse on wholly – that the light within us all is susceptible to the hungering shadow we all attempt to extinguish. For those in the godly robes, it’s all the more dangerous.

Each time I thought about this, I would consider the position of the shaman. The call we heed is that of nature, and nature only. Druids accept the call of nature, too, but where they focus on life and the biology – in its independence or symbiosis - of all that breathe and grow, we focus on the sheer forces that exist. We do not bend a story to our will, or adhere to one specific sect of nature. Priests may claim their god, or gods are the mightiest and in such, they should be worshipped above another’s, but, I believe this is the folly of pride. We shaman do not have to argue or dissect the following of other shaman we meet, because we all serve the natural powers, the very concourse of Azeroth consists of.

We strip away the complexities and complications of all that is, and find ourselves as conductors for earth, water, air and fire.

True, we, too, have precarious elements within our numbers – literally and figuratively speaking. Oft, I’ve heard of stories in which my kin across the races have lost their temper, or control, and unleashed the intensity of lava itself on the unfortunate object of contention… but, the element in and of itself is innocent – ‘tis the conductor’s disposition and actions that wreak havoc, the element is of no fel malice or twisted control, but a mere tool.

Those filled with anger may manipulate the element to their uses, but believe in my words: No matter what form a flame-wielding demon or foe may take, from candle-tipped kobold to Ragnaros himself, the element is innocent and pure. Work to sleuth the intent and you’ll mine the corruption like a rotten pearl in a void-touched oyster.

Alas, I digress. Perhaps because I fret disclosing the length in which I sat, observing the anomalies before me, or perhaps because there is a modicum of relevance to the words I say.

Earth elementals they were, titanic and bulky beings. A crude, misshapen boulder sat atop, complete with enchanted glowing orbs for eyes. A monstrous mid-piece representing a torso, complete with a belt of floating rocks jutting out either side as arms. And finally, a motley collection of pebbles, stones, large rocks and small boulders beneath, which shuffled and clambered in an intriguing motion to achieve locomotion.

They would collide with one another, giving advent to a thunderous crash which made me wince in both anticipation prior, and sheer humbled fear after. The noise so deafening, I thought it a wonder that the bluffs crumbled not.

I sensed within the pureness, the bedrock of which they consisted, an element of rage, and wondered what – if anything – had caused such a furious unrest in a material that was renowned for sturdiness.

I deducted, after a time, that only the destruction of such unrest would acquiesce the earth’s anger – and besides, no element is truly destroyed, but simply form-changed or displaced. I was not about to banish these mighty oddities from existence, as Zil’noba did the former High Priestess, but more grant them peace, and admit their return back to the quintessential truth on which they tread – much like when the spark of our most precious life force dims from us, and we return as a welcome droplet in to the rippling pond of our ancestors.

I swallowed my trepidation and began to prepare for the battle. A shaman, as a traveller of the world has the means to call anywhere a home. We need not walls and safety, but four totems in which we meld the nature around us. And thus, I began.

My four totems were placed around me, equidistant from the last to give me pure affinity with the elements I would call on, those that I had communed with throughout my journey thus far.

First, I cast the benefit of Stone Skin on my earth totem, so as to grant my very flesh with the defensive strength of my foe.

Then, I called upon the searing flame to host my fire totem, in the hopes its vicious touch may crash damage at my behest and aid.

Within the air totem, I called upon the grace of air, to offer my body to the very winds that whipped over and caressed the plains behind me, and tugged at my hair and clothing. I hoped it would offer me the swiftness to dodge any incoming pummels from the boulders, and allow my two-handed axe, also coursing with the fury of wind, feel as light as a switch whilst achieving a true strike.

And finally, I imbued my water totem with the Healing Spring boon, so as to allow the very water that provides life and growth to flow through my veins, rejuvenating any damage I may be unfortunate enough to take.

And so, standing amongst the foundation of Azeroth, I engaged.

I took my stance, and began calling on the crackling force of lightning, feeling the vibrations and tickling as the brilliant blue orb formed, then I coursed it forward aiming for the elemental nearest. I’d hoped perhaps the others were too distracted in their madness to notice the advent of battle, but it seems they were not about to let their kin suffer combat alone. As the orb crashed in to its torso, it bouldered face turned to me, and I felt those orbs locking on to my form as it began hurling forward, flanked by the two others.

I called forward another bolt to lash out as it closed the distance, and when close enough, I summoned the burning passion within me to shock it with a touch of flame. The elemental groaned under the smarting blaze, and I could see the glowing effect of my fire, aware that my spell would ebb away at its life. 

It was almost upon me now, with the two others not so far behind, and so I attempted one more lightning bolt. Before the spell had finished casting, the monstrosity was before me, towering to double my height and I braced myself, relying on my strengthened flesh, for the brutal blow I was about to receive. 

*Thud*!

Should I not have opted for stoneskin, I fear that attack may have ended much worse. I had nothing but cloth and leather to protect me from whaterver the wilderness of Azeroth may throw at me, so the stoneskin was an ally and a necessity. Though the attack stole me of my focus, I finished the cast and threw it in the face of the attacker.

I unsheathed my two-handed axe, and swung it forward. The grace of air swam through me, and though the fury of the wind didn’t help with this particular attack, I felt it clear and powerful, strike hard. A crispness to the attack that didn’t exist when I was not battling with air on my side. 

I could see the creature was visibly damaged now, but unfortunately its brothers were upon me. I took two strong blows that near crippled me, feeling a crack of bone and a pain like no other. Swiftly, I acted on initiative. I called back the stoneskin, perhaps a stupid move, but hardened flesh or not, I could not survive this battle. 

In its stead, I threw down my Stoneclaw totem, and I watched as the peeling, penetrating sound and distracting glow emitting from the top attracted the two others, but I’d damaged the initial victim too much for it to turn its back on me. As his kin were occupied, I stayed his speed with the chill of my frost shock and limped away as fast as my beaten body would carry me. Each step a trial within itself, the grace of air may have been on my side, but each lungful was punishing spike of a thousand icy needles.

I made enough distance by my reckoning, and though my healing spring totem was working to fuse together the boulder-inflicted wounds, it was not enough. And so I conjured forward my restorative abilities speaking the words as fast as I could – and though this method demanded more of my focus and mana, it was quicker. I may have paid for convenience with my energy, but the alternative was my life. 

I felt the water rush over me, soothing and perfect – a far cry from the welcoming hug of the priest’s light, but in my eyes, so much sweeter. The very water of life poured from my hands, and rejuvenated the bones – what was moments ago cracked and broken, was now repaired and strengthened. 

The elemental swung for me once more, but I ducked feeling the action speed up by a zephyr of encouragement. I thanked the air for its assistance, and it seemed to appreciate it, because as I swung my axe once more, the velocity was like nothing I’ve ever witnessed outside of such fury. A gale of wind, focused purely behind my axe swept up a storm, making my attack uncomprehendingly fast, and then it changed direction – offering me a whistled push to bring my weapon back, and ready for another swing. It happened so fast, every time the fury of wind took over, and each time it surprised me. Another attack, just as strong as the last – a power that I alone could not ever hope to match. Another attack. Swift and seemingly of its own accord.

The monster’s life force was waning, it was sluggish and weak. It tried once more to lash out at me, and I dodged it easily. Though, behind its massive stature, I noticed the others had destroyed my totem, and even worse, in the exhaustless fascination of my windfury, I realised not that my fire totem and water totem had both felt my plea for them been answered justly.

I renewed them, placing them around me and jumping out the way of an attack, ensuring there was enough distance from the initial target and me until I readied my axe once more, and, when I knew I could strike a hit, I did so. I thought for sure that would have reduced it to rubble, but yet it powered forward, stubborn to its impending fate – or perhaps thinking that very thing about me. I backtracked, which was never a good idea, but my mana was running low, the numbers were working against me. Desperately, I threw forward the powerful earth shock, and to me glee, the creature froze in place, shook violently for a second before tumbling down to a bad memory and detritus.

Still, there were two more to face. 

I admit I began panicking, and so I threw down my  totem of earthbind, and tried to keep distance between the elementals and myself, cursing my stupidity in wanting to put them at ease. As I maintained the motion, seeing the very ground beneath them shake and warble in an attempt to slow their progression, I thought about potentially returning home. My hearthstone was still recharging, but I could astral recall. I toyed with the idea for what felt like an eternity but could have only been a few fleeting second of panic, before I decided against it. That was an expert level spell, and required concentration and focus for a prolonged time – I could not conjure such presence of mind whilst being pummelled by such foes.

And so, feeling a little more ready, and engaged once more. Again, I attacked, and received attacks, I dodged then lashed back, once or twice the windfury enchant would assist me and I would cause significant damage, but then I would have to retreat a few meters, slowing them down with frost shocks or earth binds as I went, in order to grant myself time to heal, and then return. I was exhausted, I was bruised – even with the healing – and I knew I was in danger.

But, to my surprise, on one such retreat, I saw the glow of my flame shock intensify, and one of the monstrosities crumbled without need of my axe. 

And thus, it was one on one. I felt confident, adrenaline coursed through me on a level I imagine a rogue would feel matched. I roared, allowing the madness and thrill of battle to share my veins with the healing waters, and I began to berserk. My axe swing faster still, and I could feel the heat of my own fire pouring from the area of which I shocked the last doomed thing. I was swinging with ease, and attempting to dance around its attacks. The battle was all the world consisted of, no matter whether a mage, shaman or warrior – when the song of life and death is played, the melody of the universe quietens.

Though, perhaps in my rage, I didn’t quite realise the damage I’d taken, nor the expenditure of mana I’d recklessly committed in renewing my totems, healing myself, or shocking my enemy. I took a strong blow to the face, surprised by the fact I could still see – though I was pouring with blood. And though I could feel the healing spring clearing the blood away, desperately repairing the broken flesh, I knew one more attack would mean my death. The beserking had ceased, and as the madness left me, reality swam back in.

I tried to jump backward, but the creature dogged my every step. And I decided to risk a heal, but my energy had all bit dissipated. I couldn’t finish the spell even if I could remember the words. I stood, axe in hands, beaten and bruised, surrounded by wind, fire, water, and… earth. Too weak to fight, too exhausted to cast, I saw the the final blow that was about to steal me of my existence. Coming closer.

Closer.

Closer.

I closed my eyes, and grabbed hold of my last ankh and holding it tight, as my last resort, I began fusing my spirit to it, knowing that should I die now, my soul will return to live with my ancestors for eternity. That was not my calling, I had time left in which I needed to heal the world, and help people – from esoteric tribes to mighty cities. And so, in what would have been the last few seconds of life, I transferred my soul in to the relic and allowed the final blow.

Within the spiritual home of the ankh, I felt my physical form crumple to the ground and felt the elemental pause for a moment, before the rumbling family of stones that granted it movement began to fade, sound and vibrations both, in to the distance.

When I knew the time was right, I urged my life force seep out of the ankh, and return in to the body – fitting in to it like well-worn armour. I was broken, I was defeated, but what was just moments ago my lifeless form, stood up. I took a moment to sit, and eat, allowing myself to regain my energy, and scan my body for exactly what was wrong. Numbness, gaping wounds, broken collar bone and ribs, dislocated shoulder – a myriad little tales that spoke of combat. Then, I got to restoring them.

I was shaken, truly. But I was not gone.

I watched as the elemental that just killed me retook its senseless place in the world, and began ambling once more, seemingly without aim. Hiding the menace and danger within its enchanted, sturdy veneer.

Now I was fully healed, and it was alone – I knew the battle would be easier.

I called my totems once more, reading to engage in the same manner I defeated the first, lightning bolt, flame and axe. But, before my very eyes, the earth began to churn, shake and violently lurch about until, as if giving birth, a new elemental joined the other. 

I was vexed, and humbled. What was this magic? I’d never seen anything of the like before – perhaps it was better to disengage completely, approach shaman over higher learning, or perhaps even Thrall himself – this would surely be a matter of little challenge to him.

As I mulled over the phenomenon, I felt something eerie and unsettling pull at my comfort, conjuring an army of goose prickles about my flesh, and making my hair stand up on end. I spun behind, wondering if some predator had been watching me with the same intention of me watching these enemies.

And what did I find? 

An undead. Female. Decked in robes, armed with a large staff topped by a cerulean, pointed jewel. But worse, her entire form was consumed by shadow. 

I waited for a few moments, watching as she approached – speechless. I spoke earlier of the taboo of shadow in my tribe and its ability to consume us entirely, and yet, I see a member of our precarious allied race, the Forsaken, approaching me wreathed in a nimbus of the essence.

Peculiarly, she waved at me. Then bowed. I was nonplussed - an entity coursing with my fear manifest, and there she stood, offering pleasantries.

“Hello,” she said cheerfully, in the common tongue. Her voice was cracked and raspy, which is where I noticed the mottled flesh around the windpipe had been eviscerated beyond repair. Neither Shaman, Paladin, Druid or Priest could tend to such a foul infliction; that was the power of evil mains beyond my understanding.

I nodded my head in stunned reply.

“I was going to come and resurrect you,” she added, when she realised I wasn’t going to respond.

I held out the exhausted trinket, showing her the ankh up close. “I used this,” I disclosed.

She smiled, and then stood beside me – a tiny thing, reeking of death and evil, but seemingly helpful and pleasant. I was confused beyond all measures. 

She threw her hand out suddenly, causing me to flinch – but instead, I felt *fantastic*. A new lease for life, stronger – a powerful boon to my very fortitude. And once more, another silent spell, and I felt braver than I ever had, recklessly so, as if fear was but a memory I was struggled with.

“Need help?” she asked, casually.

I nodded, and thus we agreed to group up.

Somehow, in our interaction, the ground and spewed forth a third elemental, but it mattered not. I threw up my four totems, I felt a barrier of life energy surround my very body, I renewed the fury of wind on my axe, and side by side with one of the very energies I’ve dreaded may once again be the ruin of my tribe, I engaged in battle – calming the anomaly with my affinity of nature, and my ally of shadow.

“The light,” they’d all assert, each using different words, methods and gods but preaching the same. “It flows through all of us whether we will it or not.”

Her eyes would glaze over for a couple of seconds, well versed in her holiness as she was, and I’d watch as her dry, cracked lips would flutter and push against her tusks – both of which were surprisingly maintained well.

The immediate area would spark in to luminescence, a brightness that was both immense and ethereal, infinitely welcoming and undoubtedly natural, albeit in a different sense. The glow would wash over everyone and everything nearby, transforming even the darkest, bare hut to a scene of beauty – the glimmer of a diamond in a sparse sea of coal. The light itself sung of a gold so rich no vein could boast its equal, mingled with a moon-limned silver that put all jewellery to shame.

“This is the manifestation of that very essence,” she’d say, knowing we were all captivated. “Pure, direct energy, given to us, through us, to mould and bend as we see fit.” She would bring a second hand to the first, and proceed to execute a complex dance in which all four fingers and both thumbs entwined, unravelled, hooked, stroked and broke apart – then threw her hands outward.

The light would reach its pinnacle, and a silky hum would ring in our ears – soothing and calming. The embrace of her divinity would wash over all present, and even those with trivial aches, and age-earned pains would feel infinitely better. 

Often, I’d been called in to assist with restoring the hunters and scouts of the tribe, and I’d see Zil’noba, El’jah, or any of their followers guiding their holy healing at the boar-rent flesh or scorpid pierced torsos. And though my restorative prowess would ultimately yield the same results, I would watch nonetheless. As the light pulsed and waned, highlighting the wound with an intricate dexterity, before the flesh fused back together, repairing itself with nary a hint of a scar, I’d welcome the process with intrigue. The resulting groan of relief from the subject would pull a grin from each of us – shaman or priest alike.

After she would finish her tale and prayer of healing, the lesser priests would cheer, seeing their future within this beacon of respect, and, I must admit that even I would at times find myself taken by their words, their theatrics, and the sudden imbued comfort.

But, I always noticed one thing with all these priests I’d took to conversing with.

She, they, near every time, would omit the dichotomy.

When they spoke about healing, and virtue; gods and life she left out the more taboo subject. When her spell was at its peak, and the glow claimed precedence over all else, I could see that lurching behind every troll, every single one of us – cold and cast out – was our shadow. The reflection of us that we would never be free of. True, that dark companion was harmless in its own right, but its namesake had wedged its way between life and love over generations.

True, she was a conduit of the gods, or at least the gods our tribe followed, but so, too, was she susceptible to the very darkness that resides within all of us.

Rogues partner with shadow for stealth, trickery and to steal the advantage in combat, true. But they did not, could not, manipulate it. They used the natural shadow, and greeted it as an old friend. Priests, they are the very souls of balance between the two extreme ends of the spectrum. Daily, their minds are battlefields in which the war of light and darkness wages ceaselessly.

Our tribe knew this all too well. I’d heard stories of Zil’nobas predecessor, head of all priestly activities before I was conceived, before El’jah was of note, and how she veered, slowly and irrevocably from the path of clear virtuosity in to the murky, blurred annals of the shadow.

How, gradually, the tattered and quaint hut erected for the purposes of worship was soon collecting incongruous opulence, rare trinkets and balms, amassing articles of vast worth or trophies of legend – more than our tribe had ever held dominion of, or wanted to have dominion of. How within three moons, the canvassed walls had soon been adorned with luxurious furs, how her priestly robes had evolved from the practical itching fabric to fine silks filigreed with golden thread and bedecked with glimmering pearls. One could not glance around without their eyes taunted by immense value, even the foundations of the hut were not spared from such glamour; gleaming silver or gold links – encrusted with sapphires and rubies coiled around the buttressing wooden beams that held the structure up.

I’d heard many a time, how a wave of unease - perhaps the very sense of morality El’jah would preach - washed over the tribe and infected all of them, plague-like, until each of them felt a conscious sickness surging through them. 

How they approached Zil’noba – few at first, until the worries became unbearable - fearing an audience with the High Priestess herself in their shrewd expectation that something ill was afoot.

How she disclosed to the group that she’d harboured fears, too, and decided to approach the tribe leader and express their concern. How the group of worried trolls were met with unearned anger and an icy steeliness, that when pressed, broke him in to a rabid rage. Some stories say he began frothing out the mouth, not quite able to complete the words of banishment and punishment he was hurling at all present. How he reached for his famed and fabled war axe – the champion of a thousand skirmishes, and the blade that won us our land – and began swinging with menace and madness, peculiarly lacking any of the skill he’d showed over time.

How he roared at their backs, watching them scramble over one another to escape, claiming any harbouring doubts about their High Priestess would be labelled as blasphemers, and the minds in which such thoughts existed could be removed freely and swiftly at his own hand.

How Zil’noba did the forbidden, when she received a blow mere moments after she enveloped herself in the mighty Power Word: Shield, feeling the strike bite in to the life essence protection her, and knowing that the axe would have severely crippled her. She granted herself vision in to the uncountable facets and myriad mysteries of our leader’s mind, only to find it dominated and commandeered – like a vulnerable vessel assimilated amidst a turbulent and shadowed sea. And the captain of the ship, the leader of the mutiny, was the High Priestess herself.

The battle that waged between the two priests has been a favourite tale to tell amongst the tribesfolk – sitting around a crackling fire, or diluted fire nova totem. Though, the storyteller always ensured to hit home with the sincerity behind it; it was a tale of wonder – with streams of shadow intended to flay the very mind, of sharp, scorching slashes of smiting light which burst the scene in to a fantastic vision – even when dripping with danger, of muttered Power Words of defence and taint, of maladies healed and foul shadow-borne afflictions cured amid the weeping cries of others, and the confused ramblings of the mind sick leader. But the moral of the story was the most powerful defence to future generations. Especially for the priesthood, in which it is an anecdote to muse on wholly – that the light within us all is susceptible to the hungering shadow we all attempt to extinguish. For those in the godly robes, it’s all the more dangerous.

Each time I thought about this, I would consider the position of the shaman. The call we heed is that of nature, and nature only. Druids accept the call of nature, too, but where they focus on life and the biology – in its independence or symbiosis - of all that breathe and grow, we focus on the sheer forces that exist. We do not bend a story to our will, or adhere to one specific sect of nature. Priests may claim their god, or gods are the mightiest and in such, they should be worshipped above another’s, but, I believe this is the folly of pride. We shaman do not have to argue or dissect the following of other shaman we meet, because we all serve the natural powers, the very concourse of Azeroth consists of.

We strip away the complexities and complications of all that is, and find ourselves as conductors for earth, water, air and fire.

True, we, too, have precarious elements within our numbers – literally and figuratively speaking. Oft, I’ve heard of stories in which my kin across the races have lost their temper, or control, and unleashed the intensity of lava itself on the unfortunate object of contention… but, the element in and of itself is innocent – ‘tis the conductor’s disposition and actions that wreak havoc, the element is of no fel malice or twisted control, but a mere tool.

Those filled with anger may manipulate the element to their uses, but believe in my words: No matter what form a flame-wielding demon or foe may take, from candle-tipped kobold to Ragnaros himself, the element is innocent and pure. Work to sleuth the intent and you’ll mine the corruption like a rotten pearl in a void-touched oyster.

Alas, I digress. Perhaps because I fret disclosing the length in which I sat, observing the anomalies before me, or perhaps because there is a modicum of relevance to the words I say.

Earth elementals they were, titanic and bulky beings. A crude, misshapen boulder sat atop, complete with enchanted glowing orbs for eyes. A monstrous mid-piece representing a torso, complete with a belt of floating rocks jutting out either side as arms. And finally, a motley collection of pebbles, stones, large rocks and small boulders beneath, which shuffled and clambered in an intriguing motion to achieve locomotion.

They would collide with one another, giving advent to a thunderous crash which made me wince in both anticipation prior, and sheer humbled fear after. The noise so deafening, I thought it a wonder that the bluffs crumbled not.

I sensed within the pureness, the bedrock of which they consisted, an element of rage, and wondered what – if anything – had caused such a furious unrest in a material that was renowned for sturdiness.

I deducted, after a time, that only the destruction of such unrest would acquiesce the earth’s anger – and besides, no element is truly destroyed, but simply form-changed or displaced. I was not about to banish these mighty oddities from existence, as Zil’noba did the former High Priestess, but more grant them peace, and admit their return back to the quintessential truth on which they tread – much like when the spark of our most precious life force dims from us, and we return as a welcome droplet in to the rippling pond of our ancestors.

I swallowed my trepidation and began to prepare for the battle. A shaman, as a traveller of the world has the means to call anywhere a home. We need not walls and safety, but four totems in which we meld the nature around us. And thus, I began.

My four totems were placed around me, equidistant from the last to give me pure affinity with the elements I would call on, those that I had communed with throughout my journey thus far.

First, I cast the benefit of Stone Skin on my earth totem, so as to grant my very flesh with the defensive strength of my foe.

Then, I called upon the searing flame to host my fire totem, in the hopes its vicious touch may crash damage at my behest and aid.

Within the air totem, I called upon the grace of air, to offer my body to the very winds that whipped over and caressed the plains behind me, and tugged at my hair and clothing. I hoped it would offer me the swiftness to dodge any incoming pummels from the boulders, and allow my two-handed axe, also coursing with the fury of wind, feel as light as a switch whilst achieving a true strike.

And finally, I imbued my water totem with the Healing Spring boon, so as to allow the very water that provides life and growth to flow through my veins, rejuvenating any damage I may be unfortunate enough to take.

And so, standing amongst the foundation of Azeroth, I engaged.

I took my stance, and began calling on the crackling force of lightning, feeling the vibrations and tickling as the brilliant blue orb formed, then I coursed it forward aiming for the elemental nearest. I’d hoped perhaps the others were too distracted in their madness to notice the advent of battle, but it seems they were not about to let their kin suffer combat alone. As the orb crashed in to its torso, it bouldered face turned to me, and I felt those orbs locking on to my form as it began hurling forward, flanked by the two others.

I called forward another bolt to lash out as it closed the distance, and when close enough, I summoned the burning passion within me to shock it with a touch of flame. The elemental groaned under the smarting blaze, and I could see the glowing effect of my fire, aware that my spell would ebb away at its life. 

It was almost upon me now, with the two others not so far behind, and so I attempted one more lightning bolt. Before the spell had finished casting, the monstrosity was before me, towering to double my height and I braced myself, relying on my strengthened flesh, for the brutal blow I was about to receive. 

*Thud*!

Should I not have opted for stoneskin, I fear that attack may have ended much worse. I had nothing but cloth and leather to protect me from whaterver the wilderness of Azeroth may throw at me, so the stoneskin was an ally and a necessity. Though the attack stole me of my focus, I finished the cast and threw it in the face of the attacker.

I unsheathed my two-handed axe, and swung it forward. The grace of air swam through me, and though the fury of the wind didn’t help with this particular attack, I felt it clear and powerful, strike hard. A crispness to the attack that didn’t exist when I was not battling with air on my side. 

I could see the creature was visibly damaged now, but unfortunately its brothers were upon me. I took two strong blows that near crippled me, feeling a crack of bone and a pain like no other. Swiftly, I acted on initiative. I called back the stoneskin, perhaps a stupid move, but hardened flesh or not, I could not survive this battle. 

In its stead, I threw down my Stoneclaw totem, and I watched as the peeling, penetrating sound and distracting glow emitting from the top attracted the two others, but I’d damaged the initial victim too much for it to turn its back on me. As his kin were occupied, I stayed his speed with the chill of my frost shock and limped away as fast as my beaten body would carry me. Each step a trial within itself, the grace of air may have been on my side, but each lungful was punishing spike of a thousand icy needles.

I made enough distance by my reckoning, and though my healing spring totem was working to fuse together the boulder-inflicted wounds, it was not enough. And so I conjured forward my restorative abilities speaking the words as fast as I could – and though this method demanded more of my focus and mana, it was quicker. I may have paid for convenience with my energy, but the alternative was my life. 

I felt the water rush over me, soothing and perfect – a far cry from the welcoming hug of the priest’s light, but in my eyes, so much sweeter. The very water of life poured from my hands, and rejuvenated the bones – what was moments ago cracked and broken, was now repaired and strengthened. 

The elemental swung for me once more, but I ducked feeling the action speed up by a zephyr of encouragement. I thanked the air for its assistance, and it seemed to appreciate it, because as I swung my axe once more, the velocity was like nothing I’ve ever witnessed outside of such fury. A gale of wind, focused purely behind my axe swept up a storm, making my attack uncomprehendingly fast, and then it changed direction – offering me a whistled push to bring my weapon back, and ready for another swing. It happened so fast, every time the fury of wind took over, and each time it surprised me. Another attack, just as strong as the last – a power that I alone could not ever hope to match. Another attack. Swift and seemingly of its own accord.

The monster’s life force was waning, it was sluggish and weak. It tried once more to lash out at me, and I dodged it easily. Though, behind its massive stature, I noticed the others had destroyed my totem, and even worse, in the exhaustless fascination of my windfury, I realised not that my fire totem and water totem had both felt my plea for them been answered justly.

I renewed them, placing them around me and jumping out the way of an attack, ensuring there was enough distance from the initial target and me until I readied my axe once more, and, when I knew I could strike a hit, I did so. I thought for sure that would have reduced it to rubble, but yet it powered forward, stubborn to its impending fate – or perhaps thinking that very thing about me. I backtracked, which was never a good idea, but my mana was running low, the numbers were working against me. Desperately, I threw forward the powerful earth shock, and to me glee, the creature froze in place, shook violently for a second before tumbling down to a bad memory and detritus.

Still, there were two more to face. 

I admit I began panicking, and so I threw down my  totem of earthbind, and tried to keep distance between the elementals and myself, cursing my stupidity in wanting to put them at ease. As I maintained the motion, seeing the very ground beneath them shake and warble in an attempt to slow their progression, I thought about potentially returning home. My hearthstone was still recharging, but I could astral recall. I toyed with the idea for what felt like an eternity but could have only been a few fleeting second of panic, before I decided against it. That was an expert level spell, and required concentration and focus for a prolonged time – I could not conjure such presence of mind whilst being pummelled by such foes.

And so, feeling a little more ready, and engaged once more. Again, I attacked, and received attacks, I dodged then lashed back, once or twice the windfury enchant would assist me and I would cause significant damage, but then I would have to retreat a few meters, slowing them down with frost shocks or earth binds as I went, in order to grant myself time to heal, and then return. I was exhausted, I was bruised – even with the healing – and I knew I was in danger.

But, to my surprise, on one such retreat, I saw the glow of my flame shock intensify, and one of the monstrosities crumbled without need of my axe. 

And thus, it was one on one. I felt confident, adrenaline coursed through me on a level I imagine a rogue would feel matched. I roared, allowing the madness and thrill of battle to share my veins with the healing waters, and I began to berserk. My axe swing faster still, and I could feel the heat of my own fire pouring from the area of which I shocked the last doomed thing. I was swinging with ease, and attempting to dance around its attacks. The battle was all the world consisted of, no matter whether a mage, shaman or warrior – when the song of life and death is played, the melody of the universe quietens.

Though, perhaps in my rage, I didn’t quite realise the damage I’d taken, nor the expenditure of mana I’d recklessly committed in renewing my totems, healing myself, or shocking my enemy. I took a strong blow to the face, surprised by the fact I could still see – though I was pouring with blood. And though I could feel the healing spring clearing the blood away, desperately repairing the broken flesh, I knew one more attack would mean my death. The beserking had ceased, and as the madness left me, reality swam back in.

I tried to jump backward, but the creature dogged my every step. And I decided to risk a heal, but my energy had all bit dissipated. I couldn’t finish the spell even if I could remember the words. I stood, axe in hands, beaten and bruised, surrounded by wind, fire, water, and… earth. Too weak to fight, too exhausted to cast, I saw the the final blow that was about to steal me of my existence. Coming closer.

Closer.

Closer.

I closed my eyes, and grabbed hold of my last ankh and holding it tight, as my last resort, I began fusing my spirit to it, knowing that should I die now, my soul will return to live with my ancestors for eternity. That was not my calling, I had time left in which I needed to heal the world, and help people – from esoteric tribes to mighty cities. And so, in what would have been the last few seconds of life, I transferred my soul in to the relic and allowed the final blow.

Within the spiritual home of the ankh, I felt my physical form crumple to the ground and felt the elemental pause for a moment, before the rumbling family of stones that granted it movement began to fade, sound and vibrations both, in to the distance.

When I knew the time was right, I urged my life force seep out of the ankh, and return in to the body – fitting in to it like well-worn armour. I was broken, I was defeated, but what was just moments ago my lifeless form, stood up. I took a moment to sit, and eat, allowing myself to regain my energy, and scan my body for exactly what was wrong. Numbness, gaping wounds, broken collar bone and ribs, dislocated shoulder – a myriad little tales that spoke of combat. Then, I got to restoring them.

I was shaken, truly. But I was not gone.

I watched as the elemental that just killed me retook its senseless place in the world, and began ambling once more, seemingly without aim. Hiding the menace and danger within its enchanted, sturdy veneer.

Now I was fully healed, and it was alone – I knew the battle would be easier.

I called my totems once more, reading to engage in the same manner I defeated the first, lightning bolt, flame and axe. But, before my very eyes, the earth began to churn, shake and violently lurch about until, as if giving birth, a new elemental joined the other. 

I was vexed, and humbled. What was this magic? I’d never seen anything of the like before – perhaps it was better to disengage completely, approach shaman over higher learning, or perhaps even Thrall himself – this would surely be a matter of little challenge to him.

As I mulled over the phenomenon, I felt something eerie and unsettling pull at my comfort, conjuring an army of goose prickles about my flesh, and making my hair stand up on end. I spun behind, wondering if some predator had been watching me with the same intention of me watching these enemies.

And what did I find? 

An undead. Female. Decked in robes, armed with a large staff topped by a cerulean, pointed jewel. But worse, her entire form was consumed by shadow. 

I waited for a few moments, watching as she approached – speechless. I spoke earlier of the taboo of shadow in my tribe and its ability to consume us entirely, and yet, I see a member of our precarious allied race, the Forsaken, approaching me wreathed in a nimbus of the essence.

Peculiarly, she waved at me. Then bowed. I was nonplussed - an entity coursing with my fear manifest, and there she stood, offering pleasantries.

“Hello,” she said cheerfully, in the common tongue. Her voice was cracked and raspy, which is where I noticed the mottled flesh around the windpipe had been eviscerated beyond repair. Neither Shaman, Paladin, Druid or Priest could tend to such a foul infliction; that was the power of evil mains beyond my understanding.

I nodded my head in stunned reply.

“I was going to come and resurrect you,” she added, when she realised I wasn’t going to respond.

I held out the exhausted trinket, showing her the ankh up close. “I used this,” I disclosed.

She smiled, and then stood beside me – a tiny thing, reeking of death and evil, but seemingly helpful and pleasant. I was confused beyond all measures. 

She threw her hand out suddenly, causing me to flinch – but instead, I felt *fantastic*. A new lease for life, stronger – a powerful boon to my very fortitude. And once more, another silent spell, and I felt braver than I ever had, recklessly so, as if fear was but a memory I was struggled with.

“Need help?” she asked, casually.

I nodded, and thus we agreed to group up.

Somehow, in our interaction, the ground and spewed forth a third elemental, but it mattered not. I threw up my four totems, I felt a barrier of life energy surround my very body, I renewed the fury of wind on my axe, and side by side with one of the very energies I’ve dreaded may once again be the ruin of my tribe, I engaged in battle – calming the anomaly with my affinity of nature, and my ally of shadow.

I know it’s not in the register a Troll would speak in, but that would be a minefield I don’t want to traverse just yet!

This was written over a few lunch breaks at work, so it may be lacking a flow I'd usually aim for. It's also been amped up quite a lot with RP of character and whatnot. You can probably tell the chunks I wrote whilst tired (such as the super rushed introduction of the Shadow Priest, but, caveats aside, I hope this brought a smile to some faces!

&#x200B;

If it's well received, I'll happily write more - either for the Shaman or other classes. Or even feel free to request: ""I'd like a story about a Paladin's point of view of healing Shadowfang Keep."" Etc. Etc. I'll write whenever I have time. 

If any would like to copy and paste this elsewhere, feel free too. Just please reference this post or message me directly for personal details. I write for a hobby and look for any and all commissions! So, all recognition is welcome!

1694,Dire Maul should come with . . . FRESH SERVER(S),"I got to experience just a few days of the initial rush due to family and visiting them outside my home country.  I've recently come back to find the groups desperate to run instances like SFK, RFK and yes even Gnomer, are gone.  I was online for 3 hours on one of the more popular layered servers and we couldn't find groups for either RFK or Gnomer, as a healer.  Chat was flooded with UBRS, LBRS, and Scholo requests, but on a Friday afternoon on a well populated server 3 people couldn't find a DPS and a tank for RFK.  A few days ago we couldn't get a fifth for our BFD run, so someone jumped onto their 60 hunter and tanked the dungeon for the rest of us.  It was nice of them and I appreciate it, but that's not what I'm hoping for when I level my character to 60.

&#x200B;

This would also be the chance for the first server that could have no layering, which I think would be it's own draw.  I'm not here to complain about what I'm sure was a necessary evil, but a server where no one ever had the chance to use/abuse the mechanic for farming or just fast leveling is appealing, at least to me and I'm sure it will be to others.

&#x200B;

I think in the rush to get enough servers out and reduce queues they didn't stagger the release of servers enough.  I'm sure there are other people in my boat, but we are all spread too thin across too many servers.  This would give a focal point for anyone with sever alt itis or who missed the initial rush but still wants to see tons of people leveling throughout zones.  I'm sure it seems fast to open a new server already, but with the addons and information available, everything is happening much faster on these servers.  I heard the world first Ragnaros didn't originally happen until after Dire Maul, months into the games release, where as on launch it was days.

&#x200B;

Please, give us a fresh server or two (PvE and PvP of course) for those of us that missed the initial rush and would like to experience it.  It doesn't matter if server populations are already a bit spread out, server will have to be combined eventually anyway, and with the removal of layering on a lot of servers, and I'm sure some subscriptions lapsing, the hardware should be available.

&#x200B;

E:  Quick update, managed to find a group for RFK . . . sort of.  We had 5, but the hunter disconnected before we got to the instance.  We wasted over half an hour spamming channels for a DPS (You read that right, we couldn't find a DPS) and finally gave up after the rogue got bored of dueling everyone and we 4 manned the damn thing.   Managed to finish the dungeon, but can't say I'm happy with the result.",1570881824.0,"Dire Maul should come with . . .

World of Warcraft Classic. It's a simple concept, but with the proper action it could be the beginning of the...beginning. Take the game we have now, with rapidly declining users and volatile current users, and just completely trash it. Make the game so bad and unplayable that no one in their right mind save for spoon heaters will play it. Then, just as everything is falling apart, pull the curtain back and reveal NOSTALGIA ELYSIUM, a.k.a. WOW classic. Everyone will be super hype to finally go back to the the original game and play with all the abilities and amazing times they used to have. Once you have everyone locked in like a lifetime fiend, just completely scrap the current game and start all over again. I firmly believe Blizzard in going to destroy what we know now and just start from scratch via WOW classic, fixing every complaint with the game by simply destroying and starting from scratch; everyone has been polymoprhed and the wool is over our eyes.

1750,Onyxia P2 > P3 Transition,"So.. I am a long time raider, at higher ends. TBC through mythic raiding in legion. 

I did my first classic wow Onyxia last night, and was a bit confused/off put by the p2 to p3 transition with threat. My group did everything by the book to handle the supposed threat drop, and we monitored threat meters heavily. 

However, it appeared that Onyxia had a mind of her own regarding threat. It almost felt as if the encounter is bugged. Now, since I never raided in classic I can’t confidently confirm any of this. 

Does anyone have any information on this? This could very will be how the fight is intended, and that’s fine. It didn’t hinder us from getting the kill, it just didn’t seem like a mechanic we could pin point the issue and correct it to avoid issues in future pulls.

Thanks.",1570872199.0,"Onyxia P2 > P3 TransitionSo.. I am a long time raider, at higher ends. TBC through mythic raiding in legion. 

I did my first classic wow Onyxia last night, and was a bit confused/off put by the p2 to p3 transition with threat. My group did everything by the book to handle the supposed threat drop, and we monitored threat meters heavily. 

However, it appeared that Onyxia had a mind of her own regarding threat. It almost felt as if the encounter is bugged. Now, since I never raided in classic I can’t confidently confirm any of this. 

Does anyone have any information on this? This could very will be how the fight is intended, and that’s fine. It didn’t hinder us from getting the kill, it just didn’t seem like a mechanic we could pin point the issue and correct it to avoid issues in future pulls.

1775,3 Helpful Tips for Lazily Leveling your Fishing,"Hello fellow anglers or anglers to be!

I've been seeing comments about how much an inconvenience it can be to level fishing due to having to focus on right-clicking the bobber with maximum sound effects up, especially if you want to do something alongside like watching Twitch, Netflix, Youtube, etc.

Now I may not be able to help convince you that fishing is worth your while - but should you choose to do so, here are some helpful tips for a stress-free fishing session:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. Key-bind your **Interact with Mouseover** setting (*Accessed through* ***ESC*** *->* ***Key Bindings*** *->* ***Targeting***). This makes it so that catching fish is as easy as:

* Press a button to cast your Bobber (I use the Insert key)
* Move mouse to hover over Bobber
* Press a button to reel in your fish! (I use the Delete key)

&#x200B;

2. When fishing while watching shows, utilize **Picture-in-Picture** mode! A lot of applications have Picture-in-Picture mode which allows you to overlay your video screen on WoW, allowing you to use your peripheral vision (instead of maximizing Sound Effect volume) to keep an eye on the Bobber.

&#x200B;

* For Youtube: Right-click twice on the video to see the menu that allows Picture-in-Picture mode.
* For Netflix/Twitch/etc:  You can use something like a [Picture-in-Picture extension for Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/picture-in-picture-extens/hkgfoiooedgoejojocmhlaklaeopbecg) to allow this.
* For VLC: You can mimic a Picture-in-Picture function by making sure the Video Player is always on top (Video -> Always on top) and Ctrl+H to hide/show the controls interface.

&#x200B;

3. Zoom in to **1st Person View** and **hide your interface** (default keybind is Alt+Z). This just helps make the Bobber as big as possible on the screen with less clutter as possible, so that you can easily notice when the Bobber catches a fish.

https://i.redd.it/ss4no5o640s31.png

Soon enough, you'll get used to automatically fishing without losing focus on whatever it is you're watching, with the added bonus of coming back to bags full of fish!

This is false and this information needs to stop spreading. 60%~ of rogue damage comes from white hit. And white hit cap is much higher. It also affects your Crit Chance.

1859,Destiny's Proc Rate is 3.73% per hit. (1660 hits statistics),"Hello again, i want to clear that mystery we have on RNG items, such as:

[Nightblade(4.8% proc rate)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dc8pm9/nightblade_proc_rate_is_46_7k_hits_experiment/)

(list will be filled in future)

Today i want to post the stats on 2h Sword named ""[Destiny](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=647/destiny)"". In my opinion design of this sword is terrible. It is as Nightblade quick and low damage sword, but even worse, this one have 2.6 AS, 112-168 dmg, and is only 22 flat damage upgrade of Nightblade, that shows pretty good results for leveling 39-50.

&#x200B;

My overview:

I bought this one for 40 gold on AH, while have lever requirement , price does match the sword well. The sword shows up as a good upgrade to those who get Sword Specialization talent in Arms tree, as u only get upgrade for Nightblade from [Lord Wyrmthalakk](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13163/relentless-scythe), last boss in LBRS . The sword is maybe can find use in leveling but only in 53-58 period.

&#x200B;

With this sword and while i was well geared i achieved white hit of 150-180 without its buff, and 180-220 with it. Buff for 400 Attack power show itself really good. The effect is far from effect of Sven's ultimate in DotA (which is almost the same as i top geared for my lvl gathered only 189 strength), but still feeling as a nice one.

&#x200B;

As in terms of PvP i didn't fight much with my Nightblade, so i can't compare this sword to any other weapon, but with this sword i got 1k glancing crit of Execute(Rank 4) with 40 rage points (40/100) on lvl 60 hunter, while being 55th lvl, and Recount counted that one execute as ""Glancing Blow"".

&#x200B;

Proc's have strange behaviour: they come out in series. That means during one fight u able to get 5 procs with 5 strikes, but during 10-15 next fights you won't get any. It wasn't just ""one time thing"", it was like each time. You rather keep the buff than gain it. Seems like the chance is higher for ""refreshing"" the buff, than to get it. But even then buff will sometime fall off, and you will once again using fast but useless weapon with chance of ""0.33%"" per hit to gain buff once more.

&#x200B;

Overall:

The sword is ok for leveling 53-58 if you aim to never change your talents, because in this range you may find much better weapons but they will be axes and maces.

For leveling it would be better to have Axe Specialization with [Blackrock Slicer](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13285/the-blackrock-slicer), that you can get from rare in LBRS with lvl 50 (if you gather party, of course).

&#x200B;

Tell me what to test next time, and sometime i will remove the mysteries over items RNG's. I would really like to check out Ironfoe's RNG, but it doesn't seem Thaurissan even drops it. Wowhead.classic don't have any information about drop rates, so it seems as nobody ever got it dropped.

&#x200B;

And, as i always do, i give proves of Destiny sword tests:

1876,How-to change leatherworking specialization (quick guide),"Having spent a good 2h on this last night (3 trips to Tanaris lol), I figured I'd make a quick guide on how to actually change your leatherworking specialization in WoW Classic.

1. Unlearn Leatherworking
1. Re-level Leatherworking to 225 (yes, it has to be 225, not just 200+)
1. Learn Master Leatherworking
1. Visit the NEW specialization trainer you wish to learn  
1. Follow their dialogue prompts and then head to Tanaris
1. Talk to Narain Soothfancy, use the soothsayer book and select your new specialization (no specialization quest required).  

Pretty straight forward.  Hopefully this saves some people a bit of time and frusteration (much peggle was played during my trips to Tanaris at 200 and 224 leatherworking skill).",1570852680.0,"How-to change leatherworking specialization (quick guide)Having spent a good 2h on this last night (3 trips to Tanaris lol), I figured I'd make a quick guide on how to actually change your leatherworking specialization in WoW Classic.

1945,Faction Imbalance??,"I'm sorry if this is a huge re-post, but I haven't been able to find much information on faction imbalance.

Has blizzard said anything about this? They've actually f\*cked my server so bad (Stalagg-PvP). My guild pulled together to get the server first hand of rag last night and we went to BRM to do some PvP with absolutely no luck at all. The server ratio feels like 8:1 (Horde:Ally) at this point and it only got worse after they allowed free transfers off. I'm very worried about the P2 honor grind.

We've discussed transferring off but our only option is a server that is most likely going to die out when a lot more of the tourists leave.... So instead of saying ""LOL JUST TRANSFER OR DON'T COMPLAIN OMEGALUL"", does anyone have any constructive ideas for Blizzard or maybe feedback that Blizzard gave on how this issue can be addressed? My only thought was paid server transfers.... but that might ultimately be really toxic for the game (maybe not though?).

1969,Am I wrong to think ele shamans have a place in caster AOE dungeon farms?,"I'm currently playing a lvl56 ele shaman with decent gear and have noticed in BRD that I'm not far off mages' dps when fighting large groups. If the fight drags out then the gap grows but for typical fights around 20s I'm not noticing a huge difference. Still, this seems to go against conventional thinking so I suspect I'm missing a piece of the puzzle.

A very simplified analysis at level 56:

Assume: 10 mobs, 20s fight

**Mage**: 

Rotation = 2 full blizzards (16s), 1 CoC (1.5s), 1 FNova (1.5s)

(2) rank 5 blizzards = 936 dmg * 10 mobs * 2 = 18720 dmg

(1) rank 4 CoC = 285 dmg * 10 mobs = 2850 dmg

Total Dmg = 21570

**Shaman**:

Rotation = FN Totem (1.5s), CL (1.5s), Mag Totem (1.5s), LB (2.5s), CL (1.5s), LB (2.5s), LB (2.5s), FN (1.5s), CL (1.5s) *note: you better have a ~4300+ mana pool*

(2) Fire Nova Totems = 435 dmg * 10 mobs * 2 = 8700 damage

(1) Magma Totem = 75 dmg * 6 ticks * 10 mobs = 4500 damage

(3) Chain Lightning = ((1+.7+.4) * 535) dmg * 3 = 3370 damage

3 Lightning Bolt = 450 dmg *3 = 1350 damage

Total Dmg= 17920

**A little more thought**

Mage Aggregate Spell Damage Coef = .33 * 18720 / 21570 + .136 * 2850 / 21570 = 30%

Shaman Aggregate Spell Damage Coef = .15 * 8700/17920 + .32 * 4500/17920 + .71 * 3370/17920 + .86 * 1350/17920 = 35%

Based on this Shamans can put out  83% (17920/21570) of the damage of a Mage. Taking into account the spell damage it might be closer to 85%.

This seems to be close enough to warrant considering a geared Shaman in my mind. The 15% damage reduction is somewhat offset from efficiency boosts associated with mana spring totem, off healing and ankh resurrection.

I'm not saying shamans are part of an ideal comp. Only that they might be worth taking for a fifth spot if finding yet another mage is proving challenging and the group wants slightly less competition on gear.

*one caveat is that the shaman rotation is more difficult than throwing up two blizzards and you need to be careful with the nova totem threat.

Last night I started to notice that there were a lot more people advertising their dungeon farm group, but with items on reserve. This started a debate in chat when one person commented ""so you're looking for people to waste their time farming for your item.""

Last night I started to notice that there were a lot more people advertising their dungeon farm group, but with items on reserve. This started a debate in chat when one person commented ""so you're looking for people to waste their time farming for your item.""

1992,My keybindings as a Warlock - low clutter layout,"One thing that annoys me about being a warlock is all the different spells, and having it across multiple bars wasn't for me.

So, I changed them. And made it so I can use one hand to cast a spell without moving it from its position. 

If you like it use it, if you don't? Well don't..

Default - my most used spells. 

Shift - my second most used spells.

Alt - Spells I don't use very often (as I don't have anything bound to Alt on bounds 5 & 6 it shows default).

I changed the ActionPage keybinds to Shift + F#, # being the number for the page. So, page 1 is Shift + F1. 

An example of the macro code is:

**Drain Life, Drain Soul Rank1 & Howl of Terror**

    #showtooltip
    /use [mod:alt]Howl of Terror;[mod:shift]Drain Soul(Rank 1);[nochanneling:Drain Life]Drain Life

The DEFAULT casts Drain Life (highest rank), SHIFT casts Drain Soul Rank 1,and ALT casts Howl of Terror (highest rank). The \[nochanneling\] modifier stops it cancelling Drain Life it is already being channeled. I have been looking at a way to have Drain Soul do the same (make it spammable) but haven't gotten round to figuring it out yet.

All my abilities follow this format besides Curse of Agony and Amplify Curse. 

**Curse of Agony & Amplify Curse**

    #showtooltip
    /use [mod:shift]Amplify Curse
    /use Curse of Agony

This will cast Amplify Curse if SHIFT is pressed, if possible and then it'll cast Curse of Agony. If it can't cast Amplify Curse it'll case Curse of Agony.

1993,What to do after Classic,"Everytime this comes up I tell people that I have been through this before in old school runescape. First comes private servers then the bonafide game. All of the hallmarks. Even Everquest did it with Project 1999.

The way to go forward for OSRS was to try and dodge all the bad things from the newer version and keep the game a sandbox with as much freedom of choice and open endedness as possible. The same thing can be done to Classic WOW.

A boring end to this Classic WoW saga would be to redo all the expansions over again, all we really want is a good game. Classic+ is the way to go and I think powercreep is a real concern when talking about new content development.

Instead of invalidating old content with TBC I think itemization, a very strong part of vanilla, can be used for new raids. Small niches from every part of the game that can still be used is a very powerful sentiment in old school runescape and if Classic WoW does the same you can make a pretty healthy game out of it.

I will be really sad if Classic goes to TBC then WotLK and this was just all for nothing.",1570833672.0,"What to do after ClassicEverytime this comes up I tell people that I have been through this before in old school runescape.

1994,Beginner hunter questions,"I’ve only ever played a mage in both retail/classic and finally decided to roll an alt to see how other classes played.

13 hunter and I enjoy it (more so than my lvl 10 shaman Alt) but it seems like there’s so much I’m doing wrong and don’t understand about the class.

1: Currently at crossroads and have a Savannah Huntress, which is lvl 2 or 3.  I have not spent any training points yet and wondering what my best course of action should be when it comes to pets.  Do I spend points in her now, wait for another pet, etc...

2: auto shoot and rotation. The overall flow seems not fluid compared to my mage. If I send in my pet and a few seconds later start auto shot, the enemy instantly runs towards me which involves me backing up, as I attempt to watch my little timer bar on when I can move vs not move so auto shot pulls off.  Is there an easier method to all of this? 9/10 times I always end up in melee when the target is still around 40% health.

Does anyone have any suggestions or easy guides so I can learn a bit more? I’ve read petopia a bit but still on the confused side.",1570833621.0,"Beginner hunter questionsI’ve only ever played a mage in both retail/classic and finally decided to roll an alt to see how other classes played.

I’m leveling as a arms warrior. I have been reading that hamstring/sunder amor spamming is better than using heroic strike since you can get a overpower proc. Also heroic strike consumes the next auto attack and does not generate rage.

Then back to Feralas to hand in, only to notice that i´m missing one of the questitems, 20 sinew. Crap, must have sold them to the vendor in Rachet. So I find a vendor, open the buyback tap, only to see that they are not there. Fuck, I probably sold to much, so it´s been pushed off the tab.

I sigh and travel back to Hinterlands, only to find that the mobs now do not drop the questitem! I´m like, wth.. Confused I conclude that the quest must have bugged, and that I have to start over again. Back to Ferals, drop the quest, destroying all the other questitems, and pick it up again.

At this point I have learnt that you can easily farm all questitems without leaving the zone, so I spend 45 mins doing that. Midway through I have to empty my bags again, so I ride to the vendor. This time I have learnt my lesson!

2099,Paladin Talent questions regarding Talents - Healing Light and Vegeance.,"Hello,

I'm playing around with build ideas as I've just hit 60.

My question is, has anyone healed with just 13/14 points in Holy relying on Healing Light and decent healing gear or is Illumination a must?

Second question, just how good is Vegeance? Does is really provide more PvE damage for Rets?

Thank you.",1570815116.0,"Paladin Talent questions regarding Talents - Healing Light and Vegeance.Hello,

2115,I've grown up with WoW from 7yo to 21yo! My WoW journey w/my dad:,"My dad began playing WoW right when it came out in 2004. I was 7 then, and my brother was 4. His main was a priest and he'd let me sit on his lap while he played. Well, I discovered the spacebar and realized it made his character jump. Needless to say, his guildies were very confused as to why he was jumping every second - even in raids lmao. My poor Dad couldn't cast anything with me around! Eventually, I played WoW on and off from 2008, I believe. I've tried playing countless other games, but I always end up returning to WoW. It's been such a big part of my life and childhood, I cherish it still to this day. 

My dad quit playing after Cata, but he never fails to share his past experiences of Vanilla WoW with me. I love listening to all of his stories and found myself wishing that WoW would go back to Vanilla (Dreams do come true?? Lmao). Anyway, once WoW Classic launched I was SO excited! My dad is pretty good at resisting my WoW persuasion, as he doesn't want to get addicted again. But one cannot resist classic WoW mwhaha! Fast forward to today, me (almost 21), my brother (almost 18-he has played WoW on and off too throughout the years but less than me), and my dad all play casually together! It is SOOO much fun, my dad is in total nostolgia land. The fact that we can all play together in 2019 the same version of WoW he played in 2004 is mindblowing. I now understand why he dislikes the current version of WoW, it just cannot compare to this imo. It actually feels rewarding to work your butt off to level, and seeing so many people playing again just makes my freakin day everytime I log on. 

The amount of people my dad and step mom have met who used to play WoW is astounding. They moved two states away when I was 12 or 13 and slowly found new friendships through work and around town. My step mom has no interest in gaming, my dad is the nerd (nerds ftw haha). Eventually, WoW would somehow be mentioned and most of them had played in Vanilla. It sounds tacky, but it's so freaking amazing how a single game has this much of an impact on people's lives. We actually play with two of them in Classic WoW now, so we are a perfect group of 5 (that is, when we are all available at the same time haha)!

I've wanted to share this story for so long. Every time someone asks me why I play WoW, I explain to them how I've basically grown up with it. Not to mention, it's also taught me a crap ton of useful things - from learning the AH economy to learning how to spell things correctly. Anyway, sorry for such a long post but I felt that it was important to share my unique WoW journey! 


- - - - - - - - - 

TLDR: I ""helped"" my dad out in Vanilla by constantly spamming his spacebar when I was 7 in 2004. I began my own WoW journey in 2008, but my dad quit playing after Cata. I convinced him and my brother to play Classic w/me and now we all play together! I am now almost 21 and my brother is almost 18 now. 💜 Love this community, thank you so much for everything!

2127,Mark your targets when tanking,"Tanking has been mentioned so often in here but not as frequently do I read mention of marking targets which is absolutely critical when pulling a pack of mobs.

Simple scenario:  pulling a 5 pack, 2 elites 3 normies.  If nothing is marked before pull then everyone attacks anything.   As a tank you now have to throw 5 stacks of sunder on every mob where if there was a single target you could limit how much threat you throw at the other 4 mobs at your leisure.

Many times its a DPS marking targets but if they aren’t then its up to you the tank.

Now, this has also been talked about but for some reason hasn’t been clearly articulated.  Same scenario as above: DPS pulls aggro on unmarked target.  Thats their bad and unless you think their gonna die immediately I save my taunt and let them sweat.  The taunt is for the healer in fact they should rename it to the “save the healer” skill.

If there is no marked target then the blame will always lie on the tank wether we deserve it or not.  I repeat it is the tanks fault if DPS goes down if there is no marked target.

Now I know what everyone is thinking at this point.  What about AOE or spell cleave?  You dont tank when this is going on.  You let everyone know you are for all intents DPSing.  You can be kind and taunt a straggler off the healer but you are not obligated and probably shouldnt be in a defensive stance since you wont be doing any damage if you are and with aoe you need to get everything down as fast as you can.

Quick note on AOE in dungeons.  This is going to sound stupid but it is only viable if the DPS can kill the mobs before dieing.  If your mage is running around constantly blinking for their life then your DPS cant handle aoe.  Plain and simple dont keep screwing around with spell cleave if it aint working.

I also want to point out that there is value to mage AOE when traditionally tanking.. gasp!  Frost nova and blizzard can be really helpful for slowing multiple mobs down at the end of the fight.  Notice I say end and mage AOE.  This assumes you have it in the bag.

Finally I want to mention something that is never mentioned.  In almost every pull where there are more than 2 mobs at least one will get away from the Tank Maybe even for the duration of the fight.   There is little excuse for 1-2 mobs but 3+ if you aren’t using poly or shackle one or two get away.  Try your best throwing threat but it isnt your fault.  The game designed tanks load out for single targets thats why AOE taunt is on a 10 min cooldown.  Its an oh shit button because someone didnt see that pat coming through.  This last one isnt just for tanks but for DPS.  Tanks load outs are for single targets so if DPS is taking too much threat then either they arent attacking the target or they arent doing enough damage and getting mobs down fast enough.

Tanking multiple mobs is hard.  It isnt a macro, its holding a lot of threat on the marked target while holding a little threat on all other mobs while watching for the runaway going for your healer while rotating to the next target when the main target goes down.  Its harder then all the other roles. Its a wonder why responsibilities in a fight couldn’t be more evenly distributed but thats just how it is.  Mark your targets

Maybe), so he's asked me (I built his last pc when I visited him in the UK a few years back) to see if I could find a pre-built pc that'd play wow classic with 40-60 fps, have potential for future upgrades (you know, incase I should visit xD) and cost as little as physically possible.

&#x200B;

The reason it has to be pre-built is basically that he's never gonna get his shit together and get into building pcs. It's not gonna happen. He already works 12 hours a day so he just wants to game and chill with his wife after work, and be a zombie on his one day off a week. I also don't know if I'll visit again within the next year, and they'd like to be able to play together (and with me) asap.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The budget is basically £350-600 (the closer we get to £600 aka 600 British Pounds, the longer it'll take before they can game together. The specs aren't supposed to exceed wow classic that much coz honestly that'll be the game of choice for at least 6-12 months.), and of course, as close to upgradable as you can get without having to basically remove everything and put new stuff in.

So I'm a feral druid,  freshly dinged 57. Thoughts on questing through plaguelands/winterspring etc or dungeon grind Blackrock? I'm planning on tanking end game and have tanked every dungeon so far.

In any PvP situation where you would be silenced/stunned or otherwise CCed, you’d be in combat and wouldn’t be able to mount up anyway. It only costs 150 mana as well which is ~4% of an average level 60 warlock’s mana, and will become an even smaller percentage the more people gear up.

2153,I got reminded why I stopped raiding back in the classic days...,"Disclaimer - this is a personal opinion and the whole purpose of this post is to hear other opinions and maybe some comments that agree or disagree with my statement, yeah and a little bit of ranting :p

Yesterday my casual guild set an MC raid appointment inv at 19:00 start at 19:30. We have about 22 people eligible to enter MC with prequest done, so of course I didn't expect a full and quick guild raid but at least excpected to clear trash or fill up with randoms.

So I get on at 18:55 and get invited around 19:20 and was then waiting until 20:30 and there were 30 people in the raidgroup and 10 people waiting in MC entrance at this point... so I told em that I waited over 1 and a half hour and decided to quit now because that's enough time wasted for me in a fking game...

And then it hit me and reminded me again why I quit raiding back in the days... the fking 40man raid size is insane, stupid and usually a BIG waste of time. And I don't even blame anyone for this, because if you don't have the luxury of so many people on the same page and with the same amount of time and dedication on their hands, it is absolutely natural that it's an organizatorial nightmare to not waste the time of the players that are reliable by waiting for unreliable guys (for whatever reason, be it family or just RL issues, or general unreliability)

so I can't really blame anyone for RL issues or a family, so naturally the endgame of wow classic will be unrealistic for me, as I just don't have the nerve or time anymore to wait over 1.5h in a fking game that is friggin insane fun while leveling but absolutely destroying my motivation when it comes to endgame. Me being an off-tank it was always faster to just join randoms be it instances or raids and that kinda defies the purpose of a guild to me, I always wasted more time waiting for a guild group than just joining a LFG cry that only needs a tank and is ready to start

Another reason for me to wait for a potential TBC release, 25man raids were always the perfect amount of people and much more reasonable to pull of

What are your experiences so far, do you have a guild that can pull off a full (or at least full enough) raid in a reasonable time? What is your experience with PUG raids? How many people do you usually run for MC or Ony, I guess it is doable with quite less than 40 people?",1570801675.0,"I got reminded why I stopped raiding back in the classic days...Disclaimer - this is a personal opinion and the whole purpose of this post is to hear other opinions and maybe some comments that agree or disagree with my statement, yeah and a little bit of ranting :p

2273,Having fun with Classic Plus talent trees; Community talent concepts,"Does anyone else enjoy fantasizing what changes could be made if we see Classic Plus? I know The Burning Crusade improved them quite a bit, but I have a task for you. The Classic talent trees certainly have room to grow without the need to be extended vertically.

So pick your favorite spec. Improve one existing talent and create an entirely new talent to help flesh out the tree. Try not to get overpowered and do yoir best to keep the close role and systems in check.

Following those guidlines, here is one improvemet and one new talent for Protection Paladins.

1. Redoubt in the Protection talent tree has been reworked to improve mana regeneration. 

**Redoubt:** Increases the chance to block with a shield by (1/2/3/4/5)% and generates (1/2/3/4/5)% of your base mana when a block occurs.

2. Blessing of Kings is now baseline.
In its place in the Protection talent tree is Divine Protector to give a big defensive cooldown.

**Divine Protector:** Divine Protection no longer removes the Paladin’s threat, but its duration is reduced to 6 seconds and its cooldown is increased to 10 minutes.

I feel a bit off about it, and it will drop again but I’ll be resto soon and those shoulder were a massive upgrade for me. Is it fair that a mail wearer takes leather gear even though most shaman gear for raid is healing and spell damage anyway?",0

https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LV0ezZZxizseGzVo

I’m currently 25, and I wanted to get everyone’s thoughts. I’ll be dual wielding while leveling.

I’ve leveled as arms and fury, and they seem pretty boring. This, by comparison, has a fairly complex rotation, and it allows me to grind on green mobs with relative ease.

I also use this for dual wield tanking pretty effectively. The one thing I haven’t tested is weapon swapping every 6 seconds to shield slam, then going back to dual wielding. Not sure how unwieldy that’s going to be, but I’m interested in trying it.

One last note, I take 4/5 toughness and 0/5 defiance until I fill out the arms tree, then I finish those from 55-60.

2332,How much has layering really broken the equality of the game?,"I really think that the early game layering exploit has literally fucked everything up. Since getting to 60, I've met various people who are sitting on literally thousands of gold worth of boe epics, epic mount, rare recipes etc, all as a result of layer exploiting thorium nodes and rare herb spawn points.  As an honest player I feel completely cheated by these people who have been able to assert dominance on the realm auction house due to blantant exploits and masquerading as elite players. 

Are there any others out there feeling legitimately cheated by other players, or am I just becoming a grumpy old man who is behind the meta streamer curve that seems to control the minds of the community?!? 

Please understand this is not a gripe founded out of jealousy, more so out of concern for the game and the other honest players. To put it bluntly I am pissed off being cock flexed at by cheats.

2334,Opinions on loot distribution,"So the guild I’m in does some loot council thing. Currently playing a holy paladin and they’re only letting mage and locks roll on the good cloth pieces.

 After the hunter pulled and got us wiped, he left and a lvl 20 druid came to save the day. He took over as tank and i got to see and learn how i could improve. With tons of suppot from the rest of the party.
Taking up the DPS slot now i watched and paid attention to everything my party was doing and how much i was helping(not much if im honest, they totally held my hand)
I ended up leaving with bags of loot. 2 blue shields, a new sword and a level. Basically i just want to say thank you if you see this for giving me a chance guys and i promise i will level fast so i can help the next person in line.

Basically i would lose:

* 15% Dmg on Multi Shot
* 5% increased Damage with Ranged Weapons
* 100 Attack Power from Trueshot Aura

but would gain:

* 3% Crit
* 15% Agility

2463,The most insane adventure I've had so far...,"It all started with a random lfg post ""LFM Hinterlands Mallet quest.""

Coincidentally I had just accepted the Trinket quest for Dragon boi and was immediately invited after reaching out. Our group filled up quickly: 2 paladins (one lolret), 2 priests (one shadow) and me (qt BM hunter). 

I was the last to arrive to the Hinterlands and hauled ass to the first troll temple. We dispatched with the first part of the quest easily and raced to the next temple. Along the way we encountered a lone Horde shaman minding his own business.

Of course our shadow priest is aggro as fuck and started to melt the poor guy. I felt bad at first but remembered all the Horde ganks I'd endured in STV, Searing Gorge and during Scarlet Monastery runs. 

I nocked an arrow and let it fly into his filthy Orc skull. Justice for the ganks they had yet to commit. 

We mounted up and headed toward the final troll temple. Elite troll corpses decorated the ground as we ascended yet there was no sign of anyone. No one in chat said anything but we all shared the same thought: We are not alone. 

I like to think in that moment we braced ourselves for a potential bloodbath.

Eventually we came to an area with patrolling elites and had to clear a path forward. We dismounted and started clearing. 

Of course a group of Horde players pop out of nowhere and watch us. 

We're panicking at this point since we still have elite aggro. On top of that the elites were orange to me so my pet and I are doing sub par dps and our Ret was two levels below me so...yikes.

And that's when it began-I spotted their Warlock moving toward our group and casting Fear. Or at least I think I did. Everything happened so fast that I couldn't proccess what was going on as I might normally. 

I only knew one thing for sure in that moment: I refused to roll over and die like bitch. We turned and stood our ground together after I began to fire back.

But these Horde were uncharacteristically clever. They backed off a bit as we struggled with their cc and the elites. We were being softened up for a bootyblasting...and inveitably we fell. Insult on top of injury, some of us took durability damage.

Party chat was silent. We had been outplayed, nothing needed to be said. We began the long walk back to our corpses.

Upon reviving the coast was clear and elite troll corpses dotted the ground, confirming the Horde had group ascended the temple. 

Next was a simple, night altering exchange:

Me: ""So if we see that group again...""

Party Leader: ""We slaughter them.""

We all agreed and steeled ourselves as we ascended past freshly slain trolls.

A few moments later we encounter the same group and without a word we engage. I pop every cooldown: Beastial Wrath, Intimidation, Rapid Fire and unload on their casters. Our priests Fear bomb and heal/dmg spam. The Pallies HoJ different targets in near unison. Troll elites path wildly as my multi shot finds purchase in Horde and Mob alike and my frost trap procs, preventing any easy retreat for the Horde scum.

It was a bloodbath...but we wipe them off the face of Azeroth like our lives depended on it. A frenzy of spells and clanking plate culminated in 5 horde corpses ripe for teabagging. 

We ascend higher after our ritual, fuelled by adrenaline, mountain dew and unsated nerd rage. Yet in the back of our minds we're all thinking the same thing: They will be back looking for blood. Our subpar dps was officially on a timer.

We encounter a fresh pack of elites blocking the path ahead and begin to clear like madmen. I drop frost traps behind me in choke points as we progress, hoping to slow our pursuers.

Eventually we come into a clearing and of course we're greeted with another Horde group. We don't bother communicating at this point-we realize it's do or die and swarm them mercilessly. 

Their mage does some mage stuff and polymorphs me ASAP. I viper sting him and sic my pet on him instantly but spend most of this fight cc'd. 

Fortunately my pet has max frost resist so his novas and frost armor failed. On top of that my pet is Brokentooth and I'm BM spec so you do the math...my pet nearly soloed this mage and completely took him out of the fight. 

Once the poly broke I unleashed everything I had left on their remaining members. Again, we were triumphant (shadowpriest OP). No deaths on our side and Horde corpses on the ground where they belong. 

After this fight we still have elites to clear ahead so we frantically rush to finish. I cannot adequately express in words the collective tension and panic as we ascended. I continued to drop traps in chokepoints as we raced ahead. 

Soon we reach the top, no Horde scum in sight. We stomp the final elites and claim our Mallets. We even help out our pally with a short quest in the caves behind the altar.
 We immediately hearthed out after.

To the Horde we bootyblasted: 

😘 Thanks for the mallets

I am a very new WoW player, so new that Classic is the first experience I have ever had with WoW. I thoroughly enjoy Classic, and as unpopular as this sounds, retail as well.

I then hopped onto retail for a couple days for a mental break and to help my buddy who is also new.

My question is though, as much as I see everyone enjoying classic on this sub, I'm very nervous to sink so much time into the game and it be phased out next year with everyone switching.. Do you guys think Classic is moving in a direction of longevity? I REALLY enjoy how this game feels alive and I'm genuinely scared someday I'll log on and the world will be empty and I will be done.

2518,Order of Talents: Priest Holy/Disc,"**Disclaimer**: *Not going Shadow, other than the absolutely essential Spirit Tap. Just leave it off the table. Please respect this. Also note that I am on a PVE server and I pretty much never PVP.*

Okay, so here's the deal. I'm thinking of leveling up a priest. My goal is to make one tank and one healer. The tank part is covered as I'm leveling up a Feral druid. So now I'm looking into healing. I have a Shaman, but I find there's a lot of prep time and frontloading, so I'm looking over Priests as I find them much less common on my server and guild than Shammies. In fact, my guild has easily five times the number of Shamans than Priests, and I do like covering perceived gaps.

Now, I want to level up a build that buffs both damage and healing, just as Feral buffs both damage and tanking. I like the versatility. I also want to spend as much time as possible in dungeons and I know Priests are not exactly hard pressed to find a group. The more time spend in dungeons, the faster I XP. But I will obviously be soloing a fair amount as well.

So I've come up with this build that is actually pretty decent at both, with main damaging spells being Holy Fire and Smite (with a SW:P mixed in because dots are good while I wand). Before you ask, yes, Spirit Tap is in there cause downtime sucks. Those are the only points I dipped into Shadow.

This allows me to have some decent healing and damaging, with 21 points in Disc to help with mana management and wanding.

2545,Raid loot distribution systems thread,"In Classic, there is 40 people in raid for 2-3 items per boss. This ensures some people will not get loot week after week.

Guilds have reacted to this problem in multiple different ways. This is intended to be a free discussion thread, but here is my rating of loot distribution so far, in my opinion.

Here\`s how I rate loot distribution systems:

1. Loot council with god GM: This is the best loot distribution option for guilds that are very dedicated and loyal. Diehard hardcore guilds with super experienced, fair GMs can have this system without much trouble. People will understand not getting loot because it is REALLY best for the guild.
2. DKP: Why DKP is in second? Well, because it is the fairest/easiest option for classic, Imo. Its better than round robin because, while similar, you can decide to bet higher or lower depending on item quality, it also rewards showing up for raid, having consumables, however the guild decides to reward their player DKP. It\`s also easier for GM to administer than round robin, since its pretty hard to know which people of a class/spec got an item, week after week, with people missing raid, leaving guild, joining guild, etc. Round robin is binary, 1 is you can roll, 0 is you cant roll until everybody else got something, DKP is currency-based and a lot more instinctive.
3. Main spec rolling: Without DKP, main spec rolling feels the best. It causes least drama, everybody got a chance at winning stuff for their main spec which is great.
4. Round robin: Round robin is pretty bad. It encourages leaving the guild after you get a raid bis item. It encourages pugging raids and missing your guild\`s raids for the same reason. It also means fresh 60s can roll over veterans. It\`s pretty complicated to keep up with, since there is no out of game support for it. It can work if there is a dedicated and loyal constant 35-40 man raid, but at this point if you can do that why not just loot council.
5. Free rolling: Free roll is a mess and even in pugs, main spec rolling is better.
6. Corrupt/noob loot council: This is the worst distribution, because at some point, the majority of people will be pissed off and cause drama because the gear is either being wasted or hogged by officers and GM pets. This loot system will most often cause a guild death spiral, where the most dedicated players who get scammed leave first, and then the mainline follows them because they knew the dedicated players were good people and players, and finally the guild becomes nonviable and dies.

2549,Data Request,"Hey all,

I am looking to see a chart of how buffs affect a players DPS in group/raid type situation. As an example of what I am looking to find (I pulled all the numbers out of my bunghole):

A DPS warrior does 500 DPS in a raid fight that lasted for 2 minutes. They did a total of 60,000 damage in that time (500 DPS \* 120 Seconds) This type of information is easily available.

However what I am looking for is some sort of damage spread that indicates how much each buff or effect the Warrior had on him added to the total amount of damage they put out.

As an Example: The Warrior had Mark of the Wild on him which increases their STR by 12 which is 24 AP or 1.71 DPS. If extrapolated for the previous fight example 205.7 points of damage were specifically attributed to the Warrior having this buff. OR something to that effect.

So the chart would be the core DPS the warrior is capable w/o buffs and surrounded by layers indicating how much each buff added to their overall DPS, Something like this...

https://i.redd.it/1y4b57x7eqr31.png

Then, after we can see how much each particular buff adds to a specific person's DPS, we can see how much each raider contributed to the overall raid damage/healing/mitigation. For example:

&#x200B;

If we add together all the increased damage from the MOTW buff for every raider and add that to the druid who casted the buff, we can get a picture of raid contribution by each person in the group.

My thought here is that I would like to see how much each class / buff is contributing to the raid and base judgements on spec/class based off total raid contribution/potential and not DPS only. What I suspect is that if you add all the raid contributions for a particular class/spec, lets say LOLRet, and then add it back to the DPS the Pally is putting out, you will see that the overall raid contribution from blessings/decurses combined with the lower DPS of the Ret Pally will equalize or surpass the contribution of pure DPS classes. This would scale, of course, as total number of people in the group increases. Where the smaller the group the more important CORE DPS is and with larger groups the dynamic changes and those with more raid contributions become significantly more important than DPS alone due to increasing others DPS and mitigating damage via decurses or heals.

&#x200B;

I am just really tired of hearing all about DPS Rankings being more important than overall contribution to the raid. I believe, and I need data to prove/disprove, is that While you need core DPS in any situation, there becomes a point of diminishing returns where as the group size scales the more support oriented classes start contributing more to overall success of the raid and we should, instead of using DPS as the deciding factor on what class/spec is the most beneficial, we instead look at potential raid contribution (which would change based on comp).

2578,Updated: Holy Priest Pre-Raid BiS for PvE and PvP - No BoE/Random Stats,"**This is a repost with a tab including the ACTUAL pre-BiS pieces AND alternatives, so the plebs can steer clear.**

As a casual player, I don't have the time to farm gold to buy BoE's or farm dungeons in the hopes of getting a drop with the right stats. So, I've made a spreadsheet with what I believe is the best pre-raid gear that is obtainable from Dungeons and Bosses alone.

I have included some additional fields and formulas that allow me to:- Track how many pieces I have obtained and how many I have left- See how many pieces I need from specific Dungeons/Quests- 'Obtained' column can be changed to ""Yes"", which in turn changes the above figures accordingly

2598,I'm new to raiding in classic. For some reason the loot system in my guild seems off to me. Is this normal?,"Edit: my guild is currently freaking out about this post. 
1. This post is anonymous, the only way people would know this is you is if you were in the raid itself. I give no names.

2. I didn't think this would blow up, I was genuinely curious if this was a normal thing in classic guilds and thought the post would die in new like every other post.

So when I played vanilla I was hella casual. I pretty much only did dungeons and BGs. 

I recently joined a guild and we ran Ony and MC. At first the loot system seemed fine. It's set to master loot, you roll on items that you need, and if you win you can't roll again until everyone in your class has gotten something. Sounds fair to me. 

Then after the first boss I get a taste of the guild's loot council. Now to me, this sounds like something a hardcore guild would do. I'm less casual than I was before, but there was no indication this was a ""hardcore"" guild at all. The officers move to an officer discord chat and discuss who should get the loot. Before giving their reasoning, (*they hand the mage class leader a spell power trinket. Edit: this is incorrect, it was going to go to mage class leader but was given to another, which I didn't see*) Their reasoning being that he's helped the most and has done multiple raids without getting much gear. When they explained this to the guild, people started to push back.

The conversation essentially went:

""What about X? He's been here just as many times""

""Ya well y has helped more""

""Why are you punishing us for missing raids when the schedule hasn't been consistent? We're also confused because the loot system keeps changing.""

""Shut the fuck up, clear comms, relax, you don't know shit about running a guild""

It seems pretty fuckidy to me..

Later on the same pattern happened after every boss, to the point that the guild got little to no explanation. A piece of the hunter tier dropped, and before they even left to discuss the hunter class leader gave it to himself. Later on the chest for mage tier dropped, and again (not again, this is more reasonable given new info) the mage class leader gave it to himself. In the same drop a +crit and +sp staff dropped, and they only let the 3 worst geared casters roll on it.

Is this how most guilds are going to work? The class leaders give themselves the tier sets because they ""did lots of raids and helped a lot?"" Or if I find a new guild, are there guilds that just let people roll on all gear and restrict how much can be won by 1 person in a raid?",1570746234.0,"I'm new to raiding in classic.

2606,Question about Healing Gear,"I'm new to healing in late game/end game and have a question about which stats on gear to prioritize.  For example, the gloves I currently have give me +10 int, +10 Stam, +8 spirit and increase healing by 13.  I just got some new gloves today that don't increase stats at all but increase healing by 22.  

Which of these would generally be considered better for healing dungeons?

2607,How viable is this Druid build,"Hi all,

I am low lvl currently (29) but I like to plan my future 60 build. I'd like to have a all around build to PvP, farm and heal/tank dungeon to get my BiS without respecing all the time.

Here is the build in question. It is 8/22/21 going more into balance for natural shapeshifter. My thinking was that to fully utilize the druid kit we need to shapeshift a lot and it is a % of total mana so we go oom fast when switching form. Since druid pvp is lasting longer than the enemy, mana is important. But i lose 30% dmg and HotW.

I'm having a little bit of trouble maintaining aggro on dungeons, my normal combo generally is, charge WHEN I CAN, change to defensive stance, bloodrage, demo shout, and sunder armor tab on every mob, then I keep using revenge and taunting any mob that looses aggro on me, my question is, is this the most efficient way of maintaining aggro and generate threat? or am I missing something? another question, spamming demo shout generates threat more than one time? for example, I use demo shout, the mobs are debuffed, and I use it again to Renew the buff, it will generate threat twice? Is it worth it keep spamming it? or no? and Battle Shout also generates threat if my party is already buffed? is it even worth using thunderclap? Any talent advices? A slow weapon might fuck me up when generating threat? what weapon do you guys recommend me, I know it's a little bit too much but I would appreciate any kind of advice, thanks in advance guys, sorry for my english if I mistyped anything English is not my first language

This is not a story envolving another friends or a glorious fight vs another faction, but just a funny and a little bit sadist thing that ocurred in a quest:

I was doing some quests in Desolace, and one of this questlines  end in a fight between me and cultist and his master, a powerful demon. I clearly remember the quest because in another quest from this questline when I was helping the npc to find this demon, the demon and his cultist appeared in a illusion to laught of our efforts, in this moment (and when I see ""elite"" in the quest log) I realized that I need help!

but before I seek help I need to find the spot of the cultist and his master! (I do not use the quest addon) so I started my journey to the south, and after some time looking I founded both! The elite lvl 40 demon and your cultist! But just when I was going to start typing in guild chat my mouse was resting on the spell ""enslave demon"", and as a new player who never played wow before i did not know that ""enslave demon"" is a spell that evolve with the warlock, and what a good surprise when I see that this spell in the current level enslave demons up to lvl 40, so i just thought: ""lets see if this works"", I start the cast and I enslaved the powerful demon in the front of his cultist and order him to kill the cultist, laughed thinking about the powerful demon  and his cultist and his pride beign forced to fight eachother because a filthy undead warlock enslaved the demon! But it did not end here, the demon easily killed his cultist, so I canibalized his minion in front of his eyes (because I needed to heal some damage), then after I was healed I start to send the demon to attack random infernals and other demons to do damage to the elite demon, and sometimes when I send the elite to kill other mobs I hear the quote ""you will be the next"" so I lauged because until 30 mins ago this was a prideful demon, but now the pride demon become a pet to a fun of a filthy undead.
 After some mobs were killed I dispell the enslave spell, so the elite demon goes mad and starts to attacking me with his demon pride destroyed by this stupid warlock in front of his eyes, with all the dignity that left in him the demon come at me!...than I feared him and see the rest of his diginity be burned down by a immolate when I laught like a mad man!

Have decided to try tanking as a warrior in wow classic. I am a lvl 26 arms warrior at present and intend to stay that way until later levels. 

I have never tanked before and have looked on line for advice but there is conflicting advice and more of it focuses on end game tanking. 

So I am looking for general rotation advice and tips from anyone who found themselves in a similar situation at a lower level. I understand not to show my back to mobs etc but have seen some things that say use battle shout, others that say use demoralizing shout. Any help would be appreciated

2708,Beyond metas and fotm.,"We could contemplate that "" the meta has shifted"" because the game is old and what not , which has merit I'll admit, but I keep asking myself , why?

Why are there far fewer hybrids these days ?  why are there so many warriors/priests/mages and locks running about ?

One could argue that , it is easier to achieve better results, which might be true, yet are they really?  I wonder how many people here rolled priests and only after hitting 60 did they realize there is an abundance of the class running about, so much so that you might be having a hard time getting a group.

But obviously, it's because these classes are the ""best"" right? but best at what exactly? topping a specific metric system ?

It seems obvious that said metric system only covers half of the picture, like an iceberg , we only focus on the tip. Why is it that meters only focus on the trio-roles of threat/damage/healing, yet the 4th role which was erased from the game years ago barely has a touch in this ? the role of support barely has any metric value , even if you see dispels/interrupts and buff uptime, these simply only scratch the surface of what the support role is and yet no one has taken the time to properly formulate an adequate metric system uponwhich we may judge the values that a support brings to the table.

 Why is this the case you might ask?

Over the years, the support role was steadily erased from the game as expansion after expansion kept pushing this idea that we are champions or heroes , above mere mortals. As such our egos have been altered to think that we should be the stars, a star doesn't support does he ? that's more of a sidekick role not what a hero should do.

This mentality has overridden most of the current decision-making when it comes to choosing a class in classic, even if said person chose a hybrid class, the tendency of wanting to somehow make said class work by fitting it into one of the three prior roles is evident by all the people asking for buffs/changes to the current meta so that they too could play their hybrids in one of those three roles.

What happened to support? why must one push a class with such a diverse toolkit in that area towards areas it does not strive in ? like a hybrid attempting to dps on par with a dps class and trying their best to overcome the insurmountable flaws that the class has by  using consumables/items/professions,like a bird trying to become a fish when it is clearly designed to fly rather than swim, but rarely do said players (or anyone really) ever think about why these classes were made the way they were, it is clear that the original world of warcraft devs precisely implemented these quirks with 4 roles in mind not three.

So you have all these players coming into classic for the first time ( or not having played since vanilla) and their brains are hardwired into the trio-roles which has been pounded into them year after year, it is no wonder the meta / fotm class picks developed entirely around these trio-roles, because the support role has been pushed into obscurity and no one has taken the time to truly develop a system where support is recognized and rewarded for it's actions.

You might be wondering what the point of this thread is? well if you're still reading then I just want you to know that it is okay to be a support class, there is nothing wrong with not topping the meters. If there was a 4th meter showing how good of a support job you've done/ how much extra-damage/threat/healing you've helped those other roles achieve or how you've saved your team from a wipe, then I bet you a lot more people would play a support role, because all this role truly needs is some recognition.",1570727996.0,"Beyond metas and fotm.We could contemplate that "" the meta has shifted"" because the game is old and what not , which has merit I'll admit, but I keep asking myself , why?

Why are there far fewer hybrids these days ?  why are there so many warriors/priests/mages and locks running about ?

One could argue that , it is easier to achieve better results, which might be true, yet are they really?  I wonder how many people here rolled priests and only after hitting 60 did they realize there is an abundance of the class running about, so much so that you might be having a hard time getting a group.

But obviously, it's because these classes are the ""best"" right? but best at what exactly? topping a specific metric system ?

It seems obvious that said metric system only covers half of the picture, like an iceberg , we only focus on the tip. Why is it that meters only focus on the trio-roles of threat/damage/healing, yet the 4th role which was erased from the game years ago barely has a touch in this ? the role of support barely has any metric value , even if you see dispels/interrupts and buff uptime, these simply only scratch the surface of what the support role is and yet no one has taken the time to properly formulate an adequate metric system uponwhich we may judge the values that a support brings to the table.

 Why is this the case you might ask?

Over the years, the support role was steadily erased from the game as expansion after expansion kept pushing this idea that we are champions or heroes , above mere mortals. As such our egos have been altered to think that we should be the stars, a star doesn't support does he ? that's more of a sidekick role not what a hero should do.

2723,"It really sucks that I never 'found my place' during retail years, but I'm so glad I found it with classic","Back during retail, I played a druid, warrior and warlock.

&nbsp;

Because I used to solo all the time, I ended up favoring my warlock because I had a powerful toolkit: The VW could tank, it could be sacced for a shield, and then insta-summoned to tank again, and then sacced again if I needed a shield again. I learned how to take down mobs that usually required a team of three to beat (playing the very long game here) and managed to keep myself quite well through solo content. For dungeons however, my gameplay was utter garbage, my damage was ridiculously bad and I had no idea how to improve my character because my rotation was based on slow solo gameplay. I missed a ton of content because plain simply my character was never good enough.

&nbsp;

On my warrior (who I leveled to 60 in vanilla), I was still used to non-MMO games, and didn't think to look at DPS or damage ranges of weapons (pretty sure you can see where this is going). The last weapon I had when I hit 60 was the thrash blade, why? Because I thought 'Hey! It has a chance to do (do, not proc, I didn't even know the terminology at the time) an EXTRA attack!'. Among the sub par warriors, I showed how far down you can go. Heck, I'd even been considering ditching plate armor for leather because leather tended to have better agility and I thought 'critical hits!'.

&nbsp;

My druid....there's not much to say. I don't recall my druid very much. He was a night elf druid and it was also on him that I ran my first dungeon, BFD. I LOVED the heck out of BFD and I'll never forget that run all those years ago.

&nbsp;

I was never any good with any of these characters, and even now I have a warrior that I'm leveling (though gonna pause the leveling here at 19 to instead raise my main to 60 first) and I still can't get entirely comfortable with her. I have a priest and...ehhhhh? She's helping me relive the warlock days because she's a spell caster, but not much more than that.

&nbsp;

My rogue though, I am loving the HECK out of this character. I'd never thought to roll rogue back in vanilla because I was convinced you needed way too much skill to play one (or that's not strictly true. I DID roll up a rogue at one point back in retail, but near level 20 (slightly post level 20?) I gave up because soloing was so hard, or at least I thought it was, I have a huge suspicion it was because I didn't realize rogues were so heavily gear dependent compared to my main at the time, the warlock). Now you may think 'it still does', but keep in mind I'm not including PvP content (I play on a PvE server) so the list of things I need to be skilled at kind of changes here. The same skillset I use in solo content is entirely viable in parties (kick when a spellcaster is trying to heal or CC, open with a garrote, sinister strike until I have enough combo points, then eviscerate if trash mob or rupture if boss, if kick is on cooldown then gouge to break cast (learned this from another player), sap for some CC, vanish to lose aggro, crippling poison on runners, etc.). I've always been worried that I could never learn the rotations that would improve my character, ESPECIALLY as solo rotation would not necessarily match best rotations while in a group. Heck, even now, the Ass talent tree is better suited for dungeons because I can focus on attacks from behind, but combat is still entirely viable.

&nbsp;

Due to my terrible experiences with my other characters, I'd always been intimidated from going on dungeon runs, but now I'm absolutely looking forward to 5-mans and also raids. I don't think I could handle the responsibility of a warrior (stance dancing and the abilities that necessitate it, ensuring I have aggro on every mob in a trash group, quick thinking to save the party's health, and just generally having the instincts of a tank and their intimate knowledge of their abilities) and I'm also intimidated from playing a healer (cause if you fail to save the tank, then the whole group goes down, and skilled healers are still also able to keep the DPS alive at the same time, but they also have excellent mana management skills), and even now frankly classes like warlock seem beyond me because I don't think I can learn their rotation well (I used to DoT every single thing and then shadowbolt, turns out that that's FAR from optimal, especially as the global cooldown means you're not DPSing as well as you could be). Rogue on the other hand I'm enjoying extremely well.

&nbsp;

Perhaps it's cause I'm older now and have a better grasp of how the game works, perhaps it's cause I'm actually taking the time to read guides and see the inner workings of the game, perhaps it's because I stopped judging the game by the mechanics I played with in non-MMO games, perhaps playing DnD (3e/3.5e) has made me notice the importance of mechanics that I've learned to think of the game by mechanics instead. All I know, is that I really feel like I've found my place with the rogue. I never would have given this class serious consideration before, and I can see I've really lost out (although maybe for the best. If I had no idea about the importance of getting good gear, chances are my experiences would have sullied my impressions of whether or not I'd enjoy the class).

I am a non-level 60 combat swords Rogue (but will be 60 by the weekend - I work full time and go to school full time so I am behind my guildies), who was urged to go to MC with my guildies in a PuG group we were hosting. The rules were simple: free rolls on loot, MS > OS. Bindings for Thunderfury dropped, and only Rogues and Warriors were allowed to roll. I rolled a 98 and won. Some people were supportive, some people were pissed (the Warriors) and there was some drama.

I played Rogue in vanilla and actually had a TF after my main tank got his. It was sooo fun to have TF and PvP as a Rogue, and I am looking forward to doing that again. Except today was a bit of a different scenario, we had no tanks from our guild there so we didn't reserve bindings and just let people free roll on them (Rogues and Warrs only). All Rogues and all Warriors rolled. I am NOT arguing that TF is better for Warrior tanks, I know this. That is not my dilemma here. I plan to put it to good use and PvP tons with it.

But was I in the wrong to accept them? A handful of people were livid. I mean threatening me in whispers kind of livid. In vanilla I never experienced that so it really made me think twice: was I a horrible person for taking the bindings? It made me want to trade them to someone else and never log on again. I realize nothing can be done with the bindings for months, but it's making me feel miserable.

What do you think? Did I win them fair and square or should I have given them up to a Warr? Or would anyone be butt hurt in any scenario here?

Edit: Holy shit this blew up over night. Thank you for the reassurance. I know it isn't BiS for Rogues but it is for Warriors, so I felt undeserving. But at the same time, it was free roll and Rogues and Druids were allowed to roll, so I tried my luck and won. I was super excited until I got a bunch of backlash, and then I wondered if I was in the wrong. Hopefully I can find the other half in the future and use em to exterminate people in battlegrounds.

Ive been using Flurry Axe since like 48 or sth. Now Im a beefy 60 tank pally geared with deathbone set etc etc...

But still haven't found a suitable upgrade to replace my FA.

Arbiter sword from BLRS is too slow for a mere increase of 8 spell power.

Mirahs Song good dps, but doesnt have a proc effect

Ironfoe certainly an upgrade, but extremely rare

Then I stumbled upon Masterwork Stormhammer.

Good dps, OK speed, nice AoE dmg proc.

Certainly this would be an upgrade to flurry axe's extra atk, considering an extra atk with FA rounds up to about 100 white dmg + 30~40 holy dmg; and MWSH proc does pretty much the same dmg, except it's an aoe effect.

But not a single prot pally guide I found on the web recommends MWSH as a pre-raid BiS item, and I believe there is a reason for this.

Wouldnt higher dps make up for the loss of extra SoR swing? I mean it has higher base dmg, so SoR would do more dmg with this weapon.... right?

2810,How fate got in the way of what was probably a very bad decision,"So I got on tonight to work on finishing up my mount farm I have been focusing on for a day or two now as I near to 40. I checked the AH on my bank alt before logging onto my main, as often do, when I saw a [disgusting oozeling](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=20769/disgusting-oozeling) listing with a 100g bid. Being on one of the few medium pop servers, this little guy costs upwards of 500g typically, so that alone would have been enough for me to get excited, but this pet also was one of the first big accomplishments I had focused on back in vanilla on my main, and as such, is at the top of my list for classic. I thought that my mount could definitely wait if I could snag the opportunity. I was 35g off and had less than 8 hours to make it, no problem, so I set off to farm the remainder of my 100g.

After checking back and forth I had gotten a rough estimate of when the auction would end based on when it rolled over to the 2hour mark. It ended up being only around 3hours left when I had first seen it, still doable for 35g. I finish out my farm with extra to spare and go to check on the auction and wait for it to roll over to 30mins remaining. Once it did, I sent the cash over I had just made to my bank alt and got ready to time the bid. That is when I realized I made a fatal mistake, I had totally forgotten about the 1hour mail buffer applying to mail sent to my alts.

At this point, I was panicking some, but felt 35g should be doable from a guildie or a friend. No one online with any money, friend had just gone afk and wouldnt be back for at least half an hour. Panic intensifying, I start to beg people for loans in trade and general, not my finest moment, but I tried to not be overbearing with it. I promise them the 50g I had in the mail on return for the loan but no one was biting. Unfortunately, my bank alt was the only character I had in org, and my main was too far out to practically waste the time traveling back to town, so I was stuck using him. Turns out no one wants to trust a lvl 1 naked bank alt begging for a hamburger today, and especially not one named Brexit... 

After much groveling and consideration of my place in this world, I finally found a kind enough soul to take the risk of giving someone like myself a loan so I could blow all my cash on a slice of nostalgic frivolousness. I run to the AH, search the listing only to find it ended before I could post the bid; I had checked it not a minute earlier, so there was no denying I missed it by mere moments. I paid the gent who took the risk on me what I had promised him and thanked him for the trust. Fate intervened, it must not have been meant to be. Probably for the best either way, as I now at least have my mount farmed for... but man do I want that stupid pet again.

Thanks to Stabino-Earthfury for helping me out, really appreciate people having enough faith in others to go out on a limb like that.

TL:DR   Rare and nostalgic pet on ah for same price as my 40 mount I was working toward, far below market. Spent the afternoon farming the difference only to forget the hour wait for mail with 30mins left on the auction. Eventually found someone willing to give a lvl 1 named Brexit  35 gold on the promise it would be returned only to miss the end of the auction by seconds.",1570709120.0,"How fate got in the way of what was probably a very bad decisionSo I got on tonight to work on finishing up my mount farm I have been focusing on for a day or two now as I near to 40.

[Skeletons around the mailbox in UC, the AoE is brutal :D They are scattered a bit everywhere around the Trade Quarter circle.](https://i.redd.it/9e5winkn2lr31.png)

Most fun I have had in WoW since WotLK  ! This mob, Thanthaldis Snowgleam, hits 1k+ on plate, has an AOE cleave which goes over 3k on mail when it crits - and touches people ***who aren't even in combat with him*** as long as they're in range. He's quite slow and isn't immune to roots/snares, so kiting him as a Mage/Druid shouldn't be difficult.

The AoE itself is pretty much impossible to trigger from the kiter's perspective, as he uses it only on his n°1 threat target when he gets in melee range. Basically, he can use it only when a melee takes aggro from me - if he survives his first two melee hits. That happens fairly rarely actually (as you can see there aren't that many skeletons, considering I kited him like 6 times in a row and he kept running around UC's Trade Quarter for an hour or so in total). However, when one of the anti-stealth ""Seeker"" guards throws a net on him, he goes ballistic, switches to the nearest target, and everything around gets cleaved into oblivion :P

Anyway, having him kill random people around UC with his AoE, funny RP, and people losing their minds in the trade chat was super enjoyable. Couldn't get that sort of things without players in the open world.

&#x200B;

[Skeletons on the other side of the Trade Quarter, around the flightmaster :D ](https://i.redd.it/wpvqzi9g3lr31.png)

The funny thing isn't people getting OSed, it's rather when random level 60's jumping on him take aggro from me ... aaaand suddenly realize he hits like a raid mob, then sloppily try to escape and die in full fashion.

The funniest thing I saw was this uber geared almost full T1 tank who spammed sunder armor on him, took aggro from me, got down below 50% HP in 3 seconds, then realized he was in deep shit and backed off towards the bank through the bridge ***BUT*** got stuck on a corner for a second ...  which ended in him getting cleaved to the cemetary along with 4 poor bank alts standing there and minding their own business.

This mob, Thanthaldis Snowgleam, hits 1k+ on plate, has an AOE cleave which goes over 3k on mail when it crits - and touches people ***who aren't even in combat with him*** as long as they're in range. He's quite slow and isn't immune to roots/snares, so kiting him as a Mage/Druid shouldn't be difficult.

The AoE itself is pretty much impossible to trigger from the kiter's perspective, as he uses it only on his n°1 threat target when he gets in melee range. Basically, he can use it only when a melee takes aggro from me - if he survives his first two melee hits. That happens fairly rarely actually (as you can see there aren't that many skeletons, considering I kited him like 6 times in a row and he kept running around UC's Trade Quarter for an hour or so in total). However, when one of the anti-stealth ""Seeker"" guards throws a net on him, he goes ballistic, switches to the nearest target, and everything around gets cleaved into oblivion :P

Anyway, having him kill random people around UC with his AoE, funny RP, and people losing their minds in the trade chat was super enjoyable. Couldn't get that sort of things without players in the open world.

[Skeletons on the other side of the Trade Quarter, around the flightmaster :D ](https://i.redd.it/wpvqzi9g3lr31.png)

The funny thing isn't people getting OSed, it's rather when random level 60's jumping on him take aggro from me ... aaaand suddenly realize he hits like a raid mob, then sloppily try to escape and die in full fashion.

The funniest thing I saw was this uber geared almost full T1 tank who spammed sunder armor on him, took aggro from me, got down below 50% HP in 3 seconds, then realized he was in deep shit and backed off towards the bank through the bridge ***BUT*** got stuck on a corner for a second ...  which ended in him getting cleaved to the cemetary along with 4 poor bank alts standing there and minding their own business.

Ah yeah, and I had a macro to /yell ""HE DROPS ASHBRINGER, KILL HIM !"". Some people actually /w me asking me about that, some praised my trolling, some told me they reported me and that I should ""enjoy my ban"". As usual. Anyway, AV isn't out yet, but this boy is already in full swing. Alterac's PvEvP in it's greatest form :D

Kiting elites to capital cities is back boys !

2962,What's everyone's best clutch or scuffed dungeon run story so far? I need to share mine!,"I had an UBRS run where we were carrying a 57 and two 55 guildies to get them Onyxia attuned (they were dps spots for the 2 tank, 2 healer, 6 dps standard). Our main tank was a bear druid (hybrid spec usually a healer), our offtank was 2 hand fury warrior (who was still wearing his leather dps gear).



The 60 dps's were me as a warlock, a rogue, and a holy priest (normally a healer), who decided to help when we needed on more for the run.




The 55 ret paladin decided to off heal when needed so we could have enough heals to just mana battery me as a warlock and the best geared dps there. It was quite a trip of a run, as expected when having multiple healers giving me HOTs, I was top dps most every fight. The biggest gap was the Beast where the rogue was feared repeatedly and I managed 33% of damage, and yes I mana potted, healthstoned for more taps, and bandaged for more life taps.


We pulled the packs in the last room way back one at a time so we could safely have me chain fear a mob each pack, and a few fights were still quite dicey. One such pull came down to the 55 paladin tanking the last mob as the priest healer tried desperately to keep him up with just those two remaining.




Since we had no hunter, we got to do general the fun way. We nuked one add before going to boss while I tabbed back and forth to chain fear the other add. Our healers struggled when the damage spiked while having to worry about the main tank and the fury warrior tanking an add. Our bear tank died, came back up with a soul stone (I figured he ss on him was our best bet to win the fight), retaunted the boss and kept going. Around 20% on general the healers were near oom and being sparring with their heals(also healing me as the lock so I could keep up chain fear and good dps.) The Bear dropped again, but the resto druid had enough mana left for a battle rez! We managed to finish off the boss, and then began working on the last add (I was oom and potion and bandage on cd). As the healers were now oom, the bear tank died a third time on the remaining add, and then I died as the next highest threat as did the fury warrior, before the rogue and holy priest finished off the last add. It was epic to say the least.



With the lower levels doing 10ish% of the damage the 60s were doing by the end, we basically did it with a suboptimal team comp and 7 people, most of them wearing just ok gear... I can understand now how people claim 5 mc geared players can clear ubrs.



The most hilarious part though, is we can tell people we had a tank die three times during drakkisath.

3006,"What Constitutes as ""Terrain Explotation""","Hello,

Today I was temporarily suspended from WoW Classic by GM Daukkierc for ""zone disruption"" and ""terrain exploitation"" in Booty Bay, as I spend much of my time engaged in PvP combat with other players. He began our conversation by warning me to stop, to which I responded with questions of my own (which went unanswered) before he changed his mind and banned me mid-conversation. This isn't the first time a GM contacted me about ""terrain exploitation."" 

I was warned before about standing on a rope that offers direct line-of-sight to the Alliance flight path. I used this to kill as many Alliance players landing in Booty Bay as possible without drawing the unwanted attention of Booty Bay Bruisers. This is apparently described as ""terrain exploitation"" which forced me to discover new methods of Alliance-killing that fell in line with Blizzard's Terms of Service. 

I continued to kill as many Alliance as I could in Booty Bay without the use of the rope in question. So, being a Shaman, I took advantage of our ""Water Walking"" ability to escape guards by running into the bay when they'd see me killing Alliance. In addition, I discovered that Booty Bay Bruisers don't care about players who are attacked, they care about players performing the attacks. I took advantage of this by killing players from a distance when guards weren't present.

I'm writing this because I'm confused as to what constitutes as ""terrain exploitation."" If not being able to use the rope because it completely circumvents guards constitutes as ""terrain exploitation,"" then is shooting people from the bay when I use my ""Water Walking"" ability also ""terrain exploitation"" because the guards also can't get to me there? Would you punish a rogue that sneaks into Stormwind for killing and then doing everything in his/her power to avoid guards with their abilities? Are you telling me that if I fight another player in Booty Bay that I have to let guards kill me afterward for it to be fair?

Meeting all of the new people, mostly kind social people, and only 2 or 3 ignored because of toxicity/bad experience. Everyone is so helpful though, and it has really been a blast.

Yesterday the 5 of us logged on to retail (first time for me since 8.2), just to do some BG's, since play time was limited, and we didn't all have time to level today. While I was waiting for them to log on, I dropped down my Gnoll target dummy, which myself, and 3 other random people promptly destroyed. After we killed it, we all just started talking to each other in regular old /say, talking about recent game changes, and just hanging out. My friend walks up and asks, ""Who are these guys you're talking to?"" That's when it hit me, this ISN'T a normal thing in retail, you don't just talk to people unless you're trying to form a group, or complete something. In classic, I'll just sit around and talk to people, offer help where I can, hold full conversations with complete strangers, and it's just normal. Maybe this is just a fluke, but maybe classic is changing more things than just the game for the better, it seems that it's changing the community for the better as well.

I've had a lot of good times in classic, just goofing off with friends, and random people we've met in Azeroth, and it seems to be leaking in to retail too.

3029,Strange Trinket Swap Bug? Or is it working as intended?,"So, I have a few trinkets and they're not swapping between each other properly - or at least as I expected them to. I thought that any time you click on your trinket in your inventory, it will swap with the one in slot 13 (the top one) automatically. Outside of macros and addons, the only way to swap a trinket to slot 14 (bottom) was to open your equipment, and drag the trinket onto that spot.

(My trinkets: Essence of Eranikus, Carrot on a Stick, Tidal Charm, Nifty Stopwatch, and Mark of the Chosen)

The bug (?)  I'm experiencing is that carrot on a stick isn't obeying these rules. For some reason, no matter what slot it's in or what other trinket I'm trying to equip, I can't dequip my carrot on a stick any other way than opening my equipment screen, opening my bags, etc. It's really annoying. For example, I have carrot on a stick in slot 13 and mark of the chosen in 14. I want to swap in Essence of Eranikus for a pull to use its cd. But when I click it on the actionbar, it swaps with mark of the chosen not carrot on a stick. Now, take out those slot numbers, because it happens no matter where each trinket starts out - the only common denominator is that my character always chooses to keep the carrot on a stick. Granted, i do love to go fast...

I don't want to have to go and create a slew of new macros or use another addon to do this - I don't need to swap both trinkets all that often. I just want to be able to stick my favorite trinket in slot 14, and swap the rest around in slot 13.

I'm talented for solo traget damage that makes it so i crit for 100% damage and a 50% crit hit chance on a frozen traget. I've noticed some things about pvp matchups against diffrent classes and wanted to check if this is how 1v1's will be at lvl 60 aswell or if it changes. Let me know if you disagree with any of the matchups i describe, and excuse the terrible English.

Mage vs Rouge: Before I started playing all the youtube videos told me how godlike rouges are in pvp. I feel like i easily can kite rouges with rank 1 frost bolt, frost nova and teleport. Even if the rouge starts off the fight I find myself allways winning duels against rouges since i can turn into ice to remove the stun and incoming burst. I also use a rank 1 fireball/blizzard so they cant go stealth. And if I'm the one starting the fight I feel like most of the time they don't stand a chance.

Mage vs huntards: I fucking hate this matchup cause it's basicly a 1v2 and I get constantly spellpushbacked, I have never won a fair fight against a hunter. I've even tried to go in full arcane explosion kamikaze so the hunter cant use his ranged wepon but still he outdamages me with the pet... Is it possible to win a 1v1 against a huntard?

Mage vs Shaman: Disgusting class that legit one shots me as soon as they get in range... also they have some kind of silence that they cast as im using my frostbolt, not sure the cooldown on that spell. If i start the fight against a shaman I find myself in a way better spot then the other way around, but still really hate the one shot damage these guys have.

Mage vs Warrior: Super easy to kite warriors, and I'm pretty sure I once counterspelled the charging ability they have, so if that works thats another way to kite them. Basicly easy wins against warriors in a 1v1. They do have heavy fucking damage if they get their attacks off.

Mage vs Warlock: In 52 levels and I'm yet to understand what the actual fuck happens when I fight a warlock. Out of nowhere they put a greenish tick damaging spell on me, and 10 seconds after I die unless I have my turn into ice thing on cooldown. The fact that they also have a  pet to spellpushback me further doesn't help at all. Whenever I gett attacked by a warlock I just sit there and accept defeat. Am I missplaying against warlocks or are they legit overpowerd in 1v1's?

Mage vs Priest: I have only fought one priest so far, usually priest players are super fucking chill so I never find a good reason to attack them and they never attack me. The one time I fought a priest he started the fight and killed me pretty quickly, but I had no idea on how to play against them since I don't have the experience. How is the matchup between mages and priests?

Mage vs Druid: Similar to rouges I think druids are pretty easy to kite, and as long as they dont come close with their cat claw attack thingy I'm usually fine. The heal can be super fucking annoying though and I save my counterspell for it. I do die quite often to druids, but I think that's because those players are veterans and way more skilled in pvp, i don't think many new players choose to play druid, it's a weird and confusing class.

3042,Night Elf Priests FTW! i.e. Shadowmeld is the best racial hands down,"Excuse the flamboyant title. I have some thoughts I've been wanting to write down about how much in love I am with shadowmeld, the ability that my gameplay pretty much revolves around.

To preface this. I have not personally gotten any crap for choosing a night elf as my priest. I am fully aware of how subjective much of what I am saying is. I am not too involved in the community; but I have heard no one else expound upon the glories of Shadowmeld, the one and only racial the Blizz Wizz's conjured up many moons ago.

I am also extremely aware that night elves are the worst priests if you are playing as a min/maxxer. I obviously am not. I am actually playing this game, WoW Classic, for FUN and nostalgia. My main was a nelf priest and he looked exactly like my new nelf priest, sans the ponytail. Yes, dwarves are the best priests blah blah blah I know. However, dwarves are also ugly, smelly, little gits (see above note about subjectivity). And humans are just bleh. I mean I'm a human already. I'd rather play as a mysterious, immortal elf.

Now I will endeavor to list my reasons for why SHADOWMELD is glorious, in order from cool to coolest, and trying to not go off on tangents that are too long (no promises, ADHD ftw)

1. I am a man in his 30s with many adult responsibilities. I may need to go AFK for any number of reasons. I don't want to be ganked by mobs or hordies while I rock my baby to sleep. Therefore, I pop - you guessed it - Shadowmeld, and have worry free baby-loving time.
2. I am running around Ashenvale, enjoying the beautiful nature in which my peeps like to live. I come upon a hidden trail. At the top is a weird glowing stone thingy inside a tall, hollowed-out stump (yes this actually happened, though the next part didn't). On my way down I see a hordie in the distance. He of course hasn't seen me yet because of the Doppler effect (yeah, look it up, it doesn't actually make sense in this situation, but it's cool and sorta almost does). I pop SM (I will now use this abbreviation so I don't have to keep typing shadowmeld, even though typing this sentence is taking longer than the times I would have typed it from now on). Now I am able to spy on the hordie and attack him at the proper time or not, up to me.
3. I am in an epic battle that I feel is not going my way. Here I must note that if I am losing a battle it could only be because the hordie I'm fighting is several lvls higher than I am or possibly a rogue, maybe. I run away until I am out of combat, then shadowmeld out of sight. If the hordie finds me, I will hopefully have regenerated enough mana to then win the fight or at least be able to throw off a psychic scream and repeat the process.
4. Now for the true reason for why shadowmeld is number one. And that my dear readers, is Mind Control. Yes, the best and most insidious spell ever created by mankind, which happens to also be the in the best vigi game ever created. The devious devs at Blizzard Entertainment have allowed me to become my hated hordie, to take over his body, to use my fingers to type in commands on his keyboard, which allows me to make him jump off a cliff.

Now I must expound upon this last and greatest reason with a beautiful illustration of the evil powers of this delicious spell. Long ago, and hopefully soon again, I hit level 30 on my nelf priest. My trainer offered to sell me this odd little spell called Mind Control. I thought, ok cool. Little did I know how revolutionary this was, how this would become my lifeblood. I soon ventured to Thousand Needles for some horde hunting. I went up one of those glorious lifts. I played elevator music in my head. I looked at the barren yet beautiful surroundings. I then went near a hordie lift, near enough to see the guards yet somehow they couldn't see me (Doppler effect again obviously). I popped SM and waited. Meanwhile, a hordie rode up his own lift, enjoying the scenery, maybe even listening to elevator music in his head. He naively walks down the narrow path, not seeing me until it is too late! I start casting MC at the appropriate time. Before he can run or attack or react in any way that would abuse me of my advantage, I am controlling him. I have mere seconds to react, yet I need only a couple at most. I turn 90 degrees and run off the precipice. By the time I lose control of them it is too late. The orcy, bully, trolly, or icky hordie falls to a long awaited splat while listening to my elven laughter (I realize mages and priests might be able to save themselves, whereby we may have an honorable duel in a few minutes). I will of course silence them at the appropriate time when they do. Don't even get me started on Silence, the second coolest spell of all time.

In conclusion, Night Elf Priests are r0xx0rz

3066,Feedback Needed: Layering causing issue with Ony Rallying Cry buff?,"Hello everyone. 

I would like to check with the community before contacting blizzard to see if anyone is having this issue as well. That way, before I contact Blizzard about this being a possible bug, I can include all your experiences as well and hope you all can provide any additional feedback that may be necessary.

The server I am playing on is Fairbanks. New status is Layered for population due to the amount of people. My understanding is that there are currently enough people logged in to cause there to be a layer (otherwise no layer exists).  Last night, we got Ragnaros to 1% before submerge and wiped. We all made our way to Orgrimmar to secure Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer which would ensure we downed the boss. ***Onyxia's head was not on a spike in central Orgrimmar meaning that the buff was available once head was turned in (my assumption***). Upon turning in the head quest and the followup of receiving the item, no RP started, no buff was received, no head on a spike appeared. Which was quite a big blow to a pug raids morale. 

..........

My thought on possible bug:

With layering being reduced and only applicable when needed - this is causing an error with raid buffs.

Lets say MAIN\_REALM\_X spawns SHARD\_REALM\_X due to population. 

If MAIN\_REALM\_X players turn in Ony head -> MAIN\_REALM\_X gets onyxia's head on a spike and buff.. lets call this scenario MAIN\_REALM\_CD. 

MAIN\_REALM\_CD should not affect SHARD\_REALM\_CD. But it is.

Has this happened to anyone else? I noticed this with rend head as well but don't know the cooldown on that or how to check if it has been popped before. Therefore, I'm not including this in the report.",1570676514.0,"Feedback Needed: Layering causing issue with Ony Rallying Cry buff?Hello everyone.

3068,Feral PVP Gearing? (0/30/21),"Hi there,

I played Druid back in vanilla, and it was considered to be pretty good if you had all the gear, but that gear was also ridiculously difficult to obtain.  The promise of a high utility melee class with good sustained damage (and a little burst) finally began to come into focus once you had high level equipment but before that, the stats were spread too thin on most equipment.  You'd see raiding druids with t2/3 equipment swapping into their Feralheart for feral PVP (lol).

The big problem here was that all the good stuff you'd want for Feral was actually dropped in high level raids, and since there weren't many Feral Druids in the raids and the items had really good Warrior or Rogue stats, Druids almost never actually received those items when they still mattered.  So the PVP Druid track was to go like 30/21 and heal your raids and then after you gained all of your healing gear and went into DKP debt you'd save up to buy the stuff no one wanted from the previous tier, thus having gear, but being behind an entire tier and being out a bunch of DKP.

Every now and then you'd see a fucking Unicorn of a Feral Druid with the AQ40 mace and a bunch of amazing hybrid gear in the current raid tier, impossible to kill and dealing out very strong damage over time.  It worked because the hybrid playstyle seemed to scale really well with gear in a PVP environment.  We all wanted to be him, but realistically you weren't gonna be him.

My question is:  does Feral PVP have a better gear track than this, with all of our retrospect and modern theory-crafting?   I'd imagine you want to kind of bee-line for the Nighmare Dragons/AQ20 maces, but aside from that...?",1570675876.0,"Feral PVP Gearing? (0/30/21)Hi there,

My question is:  does Feral PVP have a better gear track than this, with all of our retrospect and modern theory-crafting?   I'd imagine you want to kind of bee-line for the Nighmare Dragons/AQ20 maces, but aside from that...?",0

3090,How is your class adapting to current endgame?,"I never raided on a private server so I didn't really know what to expect when it comes to encounter timelines and an efficient rotation. I followed a few of the many available guides online for suggested spell/rank priority for Holy Priest and it quickly became evident that there was way too much focus on mana preservation in the guides. 

Kill times on the vast majority of bosses are simply too short (~ 120 sec) to worry about mana efficiency unless you are trying to run a raid with minimal consumables. The reality of a good parse now is simply use max or near max rank Flash Heal for a surprisingly significant portion of raid healing and just pot/rune through the hefty mana costs. Even if you wanted to use slower and more mana efficient casts, there is a good chance your heal is going to get sniped and you'll be wasting mana on overhealing anyways.

It at least gives me an equal change to get loot drops compared to other veterans/main tanks hogging all the loot. I’m very new to all this, so maybe I’m being a little naive here, but this is just a first impression.

It has a ton of economy effects, sure, but PvP ranking was always the largest part of P2, and P2 is a bit of a buffer phase anyway since there's no new raid content.

What I think is interesting is that Blizz is now saying that content will be staggered outside of the phases, in mini-update patches. What else do people think will be moved to a separate update? Personally, I think we'll see this:

P3: WSG, and possibly AV as well, will almost assuredly get moved up to an update patch partway through P2 IMO. BWL is obviously the biggest part of this update and won't get moved. Once people start seeing non-stop campers outside of every 50+ dungeon, people will start asking for BGs real quick.

P4: A lot less to work with here, ZG again as the big update will not get moved; but they could add the green dragons early for more world bosses.

P5: I could almost see them starting the AQ war effort early, but holding the release till P5? It'll be very interesting to see how the war effort plays out this time, and I wouldn't be surprised if Blizz changed it slightly to prevent it getting rushed by all the people stockpiling mats in advance. It's either that, or the gear update; either of which I think would be fine mini-patches

I’m on the final stretch as I just hit 58. I’ve leveled as arms, but I’m getting ready to make the jump to prot so I can tank endgame content.

3146,Constant crashes (seemingly after last Windows update),"I am using Windows 10, and had no problems paying Classic until two days ago. There was a regular Windows update, now the game crashes constantly.

I can log in fine, when I enter the world with my character, it usually takes moments (from a few seconds to a few minutes) for my screen to turn black (the screens OSD pops up, saying ""No Signal""). The ingame sounds continue to play, I can still interact the game (i.e. if I mount up, I can hear the according sound). From my symptoms, I understand I am encountering a ""driver crash"", the common solution for this is, to get rid of ingame overlays like Xbox.

What I tried so far:

- Scan and repair files from the Battle.net launcher -> no errors found
- Update graphics drivers (AMD Vega 56, driver version
19.10.1)
- Uninstalled the Xbox app. However my system still has the Xbox Game Bar and the Xbox Game Speech Window. They don't have an uninstall option, I'm still working on getting rid of them.

Is there anything known about the current Windows Update or WoW patch that may cause the issues? Does anyone else have similar problems? And what are some more things I can try? Reinstalling Windows would be my very last resort...

3178,My first Warlock and I’m loving it!,"Positive but long warlock rant/story incoming. 

So I never played vanilla before. I started in TBC and haven’t played in a longg time. Friends convinced me to get classic and while I was very hesitant and told myself I would never play again, here I am, completely sucked back in and having more fun than ever.   

Too the level 45 mage, 47 warrior, and 51 rogue I kept killing last night in the Feralas yeti cave, sorry not sorry.  Im level 49 atm. Being a warlock I can’t help being a little evil. It started with the lowbie mage, I couldn’t resit throwing a couple dots on him for killing my yetis. I absolutely hate any yeti quest as it always takes ungodly amounts of kills for drops so I had to break up the monotony. I killed him a couple times as he tried to get out of the deepths of the cave. Then I stumbled upon the 47 warrior also taking my yetis. I could not let this happen so bye bye warrior.  I continued to quest freely killing my alliance buddies whenever they popped back up. That’s when the 51 rogue popped up. He was questing and didn’t initially attack me so I let him be as while I am evil I’m no dummy and don’t tend to punch up unless provoked. And at this point I know I’m going to be outnumbered being the only horde at the moment and decide to play nice. 

As i leave the cave, I run back into mr. warrior and decide to spare his life. However he does not wish to play nice anymore and charges me as i wave. I dot him up and as I kill him I am opened up on by mr. rogue.   Well now I must fight to survive. To my suprise I end up killing him as well although I am at low health. I heal back up feeling great as I continue to rule my yeti cave.  I kill mr. mage again and after the warrior and rogue are back alive I realize i have 3 min left on my soulstone. Theyre both full hp back at the entrance killing yetis. I can not resist my free res almost being up and decide to take them both head on.  It was a hard fought battle and they killed me, but I simply used my ss and finished them off laughing at they’re lifeless corpses. 

Now very low without my void or ss i reup on everything and put a new ss on. Now that I’m back to fighting strength i come out from behind my tree and see mr mage on his mount. I quickly open up to realise they are all right there waiting for me.  Immediately I’m jumped on my mr. warrior and mr. rogue. Mage dies fast w dots as he tries to escape and I start going at it with the other two. They end up killing me again but I already have my ss on. I watch as the warrior ticks away and as he starts using his bandage with about ten hp i res and auto him. Mr. rogue is at full hp as I fucked up and didn’t focus him at all. But again i keep him feared and deal with him relatively easily. At this point I feel invincible and can’t believe I’ve been able to kill them all so much.  I killed them individually a couple more times as they spawned and fled and let them run away with their tails between their legs. Damn it feels good to be a warlock. 

Anyways rant over. Just wanted to share my pvp funtimes i had last night. 

I feel like I shouldn’t have been able to take them all on like that alone? But I enjoyed every second of it. Might not have been so fun if I was on the other end though XD",1570665189.0,"My first Warlock and I’m loving it!Positive but long warlock rant/story incoming.

3181,The Greed,"I have a story from back when I was playing WoW, back in the ""real"" classic.

I had a priest that I played, my friends were always ahead of me in levels and I basically had little knowledge of what I even was suppose to do. 

The way I was playing the game was like you get quests, I would get a quest in Thousand Needles that would tell me to go to Badlands, so I went to the badlands and then I did that quest and then returned to Thousand Needles, not the best useage of time, but there was some reward that I would want and so thats how I played.

Anyway I managed to get to 56 and then I just felt like I was stuck in that same level forever, I played some Alterac Valley and tried to do the quests (that everyone els already did or did not care to do).

So I stopped playing for a few weeks, then I logged in just before my subscription ended and just did not feel like playing anymore..

As I was wandering around Ogrimmar, some low lvl was asking me for gold, I had maybe 70 gold on me and I felt like I wanted to make some low lvl happy, after all remembered how hard it is to get money. 

I traded him and gave him all my money, he started to ask me why I gave so much and I told him that I did not feel like playing anymore, he then asked me if I had stuff in my bank that I could sell so that I could give him more, so I did.

Then when he finally got everything from my bank and my purse, he then asked me :

""Do you really need the gear you have on you?"" 

and I said ""Well... no, not really.""

""Can you sell it and give me the money?"" 

I dont know why, but I sold my stuff and gave a measly 1-3 gold and then he asks ""Do you have any other characters that have gold?""

Now I lied and said no, not because I did not have any valuable gear or stuff on my alts, it was just the princaple that he kept asking for more when I already gave him so much.

I guess in the end I just wanted him to be thankful and he was never satisfied.

All I got was a ""thx"".

I had a priest that I played, my friends were always ahead of me in levels and I basically had little knowledge of what I even was suppose to do. 

The way I was playing the game was like you get quests, I would get a quest in Thousand Needles that would tell me to go to Badlands, so I went to the badlands and then I did that quest and then returned to Thousand Needles, not the best useage of time, but there was some reward that I would want and so thats how I played.

Anyway I managed to get to 56 and then I just felt like I was stuck in that same level forever, I played some Alterac Valley and tried to do the quests (that everyone els already did or did not care to do).

So I stopped playing for a few weeks, then I logged in just before my subscription ended and just did not feel like playing anymore..

As I was wandering around Ogrimmar, some low lvl was asking me for gold, I had maybe 70 gold on me and I felt like I wanted to make some low lvl happy, after all remembered how hard it is to get money. 

I traded him and gave him all my money, he started to ask me why I gave so much and I told him that I did not feel like playing anymore, he then asked me if I had stuff in my bank that I could sell so that I could give him more, so I did.

Then when he finally got everything from my bank and my purse, he then asked me :

""Do you really need the gear you have on you?"" 

and I said ""Well... no, not really.""

First of all, i have to say that i've never played vanilla. I started with MoP but I'm more of a casual player.. Anyways, i started playing classic and created an org shaman, because i like the playsyle of the Enhancer and am a big fan of the lore. Now i've read that the only spec which is viable in raids is the healer. Here I have to admit that i have never done or watched a Raid, because i was never on the endcontent. Long story short, my question is: Are people really that strict in selecting the raidmembers? I mean if i want to go as dd (even tho the shaman isn't that good obviously in classic) will they really reject me? I cant believe that it makes THAT much of a difference.. But as i said, i never did a Raid, is it really that difficult, so you cant take anything other than the meta DD's with you?

3222,Stressed about respeccing as a Shaman.,"So guys. I'll try to make this as short as possible. I've been playing as an Enhancement shaman for 54 levels so far, and have been enjoying it all the way. My friends hit level 60 some time ago already, and have startet raiding with a guild. They play solid DPS classes, and have so far had no problem finding a place in the raid. I on the other side, as an Enhance, know that I have to accept that there perhaps won't be a spot for me in a raid group, and therefore I've been planning on respeccing for the whole time.
 
Yesterday I got the idea of trying to respec to the 30/0/21 shaman build, and play the last levels as an elemental/resto build. Well I got a little too eager and bought a lot of new gear and what not, because I just couldn't wait to try it out. Well.... After spending about 50g on gear and respec and spells I hadn't learnt I got out and tried it off in a BRD Arena/Anger run. It went OKAY, but boy I did not enjoy it. I actually didn't enjoy anything about it. After that I went out and tried to level a bit for my self, but found it super challenging to get used to being a caster instead.
Now Im a bit stressed, because It seems like I don't enjoy healing, but this seems to be the only outcome for my Shaman when i hit level 60. I really wanna join my friends for raiding, and thought it wouldn't be a problem. 

My question to you guys is, if I should keep the spec, and try to get better at healing, or if I should go back to Enhancement, take it as an expensive lesson and try and accept that I won't get a raiding spot like my friends does.",1570660560.0,"Stressed about respeccing as a Shaman.So guys.

3231,How often do you have to stop and drink (for mana) during a dungeon run?,"My main is a level 32 warrior. When I'm tanking a dungeon I make sure to mind my healer's mana level. When I see it's low, I will pause (and turn to look at them) before a pull to see if he/she is going to drink. If he/she doesn't start drinking after a few seconds, I'll go on with the pull (I trust he/she knows how to manage mana). If I see my healer (or more than one non-healer) sit to drink, I will also sit (usually facing the healer/drinkers). I sit to show the rest of the group that I'm not about to start a pull, so everyone can chill and/or drink/eat.

I've never thought that any group had to stop and drink a lot or too much. But I've never actually counted.

Last night I was on my alt level 19 shaman, healing for a Wailing Caverns run. I went into the dungeon with 16 melon juices -- each one enough to fully restore my mana. I think I manage my mana well -- I try not to waste it on unnecessary heals, and never on attacks -- but half way through WC I ran out of juice. I had to ask the mage for water. I don't remember how many of the fresh stack I ended up drinking for the rest of the dungeon. This made me feel like I was doing something seriously wrong.

How many times is ""normal"" to drink during a dungeon run. Is 20+ times too much? Am I more inefficient than I think?",1570659569.0,"How often do you have to stop and drink (for mana) during a dungeon run?My main is a level 32 warrior. When I'm tanking a dungeon I make sure to mind my healer's mana level. When I see it's low, I will pause (and turn to look at them) before a pull to see if he/she is going to drink. If he/she doesn't start drinking after a few seconds, I'll go on with the pull (I trust he/she knows how to manage mana). If I see my healer (or more than one non-healer) sit to drink, I will also sit (usually facing the healer/drinkers). I sit to show the rest of the group that I'm not about to start a pull, so everyone can chill and/or drink/eat.

I've never thought that any group had to stop and drink a lot or too much. But I've never actually counted.

Last night I was on my alt level 19 shaman, healing for a Wailing Caverns run. I went into the dungeon with 16 melon juices -- each one enough to fully restore my mana. I think I manage my mana well -- I try not to waste it on unnecessary heals, and never on attacks -- but half way through WC I ran out of juice. I had to ask the mage for water. I don't remember how many of the fresh stack I ended up drinking for the rest of the dungeon. This made me feel like I was doing something seriously wrong.

3287,"Hunters and their ""crit softcap"".","I'm Making my own BiS(upgrade)lists and comparing gear for my hunter instead of blindly following a guide currently.
I have been reading up a lot on stat effectiveness for hunters in classic, together with stat priorities. However i have not been able to figure out the calculation that is used to determine the hunter crit softcap that comes by every once in a while. 

Basics for a hunter:
Agi = 2 ranged AP.
53 agi = 1% crit
1% crit = 32 (r)AP (roughly, according to icy veins.)

this would combine to 1 agi being worth about 2.6 ranged attack power.

This all seems common knowledge and is stated by multiple sources.

Now what concerns me is the statement on wowhead about hunter attributes and stats that crit with moral shots softcaps at around 19 to 20%. From that point onwards AP will get better compared to crit. however they dont back that statement up with a deminishing formula, and as such i cant base my further gearing on that descicion. 

Forinstance: i currently sit at 24% crit raidbuffed. past said ""softcap"". when diremaul goes live i can get brutality blade for 60 AP and 1% crit, Or i can get huntsman's harpoon for 35 Agi.

As we stated above, 35 agi is 70 Flat AP. Which means this is 10 AP more than the brutality blade.
The crit from the 35 agi is about 0.66%. (35/53).
this means that brutality blade has 0.36% crit more, but 10 AP less.
In normal circumstances i'd pick the brutality blade for this reason, since 1 crit is about 32 AP, so slightly over a third crit would be slightly more than 10 AP. 

However if the diminishing returns of the worth of crit are true, then the harpoon would technically be slightly better from a ranged DPS perspective. 

Sadly i am not proficient enough in math to fully understand how strongly the worth of crit deminishes versus AP, and why this would happen after roughly 20% crit at all anyway when lethal shots is taken. (lethal shots gives 230% crit dmg btw, opposed to the normal 200%). 

So my question to you reddit:
Is that crit softcap a thing? because ive only seen it on 1 source and without math backing it up
Do you happen to know the math behind it so i could optimize my gear better?

Feel free to point out any mistakes i made aswell, Saves me farming for something i dont need.

Juat a story you remember.,When wow came out i was in middle school. My mom would never allow me to get a subscription to a video game. I was forced to create trial accounts that locked after level 10. I was a pro at getting to ten. Well my best friend had an account that i would play when he was sleeping or wasnt on. Id steal a few gold from him and make a toon and start playing till level 10 then restart.....ironic huh. Well one of my first night elf toons i found a nice night elf who was in the 20s. He was wondering around dark shore and i asked him to run me to SW in exchange for a couple gold. So we did. We took the boat to the wetlands then ran to loch modan. Then instead of heading to IF for the public transport we went right past it and ram through the gorge. It took us a few hours of dying and rezzing to get to red ridge. But i finally made it to elywin and i have to say the calm green was a sight to behold. Now by the time i got there it was 4am and bedtime. And i dont think i ever played that toon again. But i will never forget the friend of mine who ran me accros the continent for 1 gold piece.,1570652178.0,Hey friends. I wanted to start a noob post about when we all started.

3309,No or just small tips for enchanting?,"I started wow classic with enchanting as my main profession. As I leveled up I was very lucky, people left greens and blues that nobody in the group needed for me to disenchanted them. I was able to skill quite fast.

3356,Which features from actual can improve classic experience?,"If we throw away all the nostalgic feelings and look at things objectively, how do you think what from the actual wow would be appropriate in the classics to make it even more interesting(not the easier)?

In my opinion this feature will open opportunity to enjoy pvp and pve aspects for same character without wild farm for 50gold each time when we want to go dungeon or pvp events. OFC it shouldn't be so easy to unlock this feature (not at lvl 40 and not for 1000 gold also)   
Probably it should be quest chain after clearing endgame content (e.g. killing Kel'thuzad will unlock quest chain for dual spec) or something like that, so after character fully equipped for PVE there are will be opportunity to spend more time on pvp fun and you still will be able to help your guild in PVE.

recently there are many posts about dungeon finder where you queue and get thrown into a dungeon.

I think we can all agree that tool is stupid and destroys the whole social aspect of the game.

My idea is something different:

What do you guys think about a board in all main citys where you can ""hang up"" create groups like people do by spamming chat. You set what dungeon you wanna go and what you already have. Now people could also visit that board and look what groups are currently available and apply for them. The group host gets notifyed about who wanted to join and can invite them.

This system would only cover group making you still have to make your way to the dungeon.

It would give us a realistic way of making groups instead of spamming a chat.

WoW Classic is my first ever WoW experience. I played a lot of Hearthstone but I'd always avoided committing to WoW because I knew full well the addiction would take over. And my god it has. But yesterday evening, I had a moment that has left me feeling ready to throw in the towel.

Picture this: You've grinded your way to a LVL 59 Warrior, and a LVL 32 Paladin. It's your first time ever playing this game in any capacity, and you're near the levelling finish line. You sign in.   
Immediately, my heart sinks. I see both my characters in the selection screen are naked. ""A bug?"" I think, half hoping that a minor glitch was all that I was seeing.  
I select my LVL 59 Warrior in a panic, and enter the world. This is when reality really struck, he was naked, with less than 5 silver in his pocket, standing by the mailbox.

  
Mount? *Gone*. Gold? *Gone*. Gear? *Gone*. Bank? *Emptied*.

&#x200B;

At this moment I realise all is lost. Someone has taken everything.  


I immediately jump over to the Blizzard Support Page and raise a ticket, informing them of my horror.

They must have simultaneously been approving other people's connections to sign in. 

Germany, Russia, Turkey. My recent log in activity is a medley of nations.  


My ticket process continues. I pray Blizzard can help me, forgive my foolishness, and get me back on track to my goal of reaching 60 with more than my mildly clammy hands.

3389,Questions regarding Hunter pets in raiding.,"I apologize in advance if my questions are already answered elsewhere, I tried searching but couldn't find exactly what I was looking for.   
&nbsp;

As a filthy casual with a full time job and 3 kids I'm about to hit 60 on my hunter this week. YAY! I still have some questions in regards to pets and their talents in endgame.  
&nbsp;

1) I understand that if you are put in the melee group you should use a wolf for furious howl. Some guides suggest to keep the pet near the hunter and not on the boss so it won't die. But if I do that then it won't buff the melees because I probably won't be standing only 15 yards away from the boss, right? So how do you handle that? Do you ""park"" your pet about 10 yards away from the boss and close to the melee group? Does it even how automatically when I have autocast activated or do I have to do it manually? (Never had a wolf before...)  
&nbsp;

2) If I'm put in the caster group I would use a cat. How should I spend the talent points? Max Bite and Claw plus Dash? Rest of the points in max fire resistance and rank 8 greater stamina?  
&nbsp;

3) Talent points for a wolf would be the same as for the cat, except that Furious Howl would replace claw?  
&nbsp;

4) How would I have to spend the pet talent points on my cat for PvP? Claw, Bite, Dash and max stamina? Frost resistance?  
&nbsp;

5) During the whole levelling process I have stuck to boars. I really like their charge ability and tankiness. My cat and wolf will only be used for raids and PvP. Keeping my trusty boar for solo farming. Will I ever have to get a wind serpent? For example when ZG comes out or is that never really necessary since I won't be raiding in a top guild anyway?

The thing is that i felt more and more that blizzard became a money hungry machine that replaced the game quality priority with store items and promotions. I was paying what was for me big money for hearthstone. I was preordering expansions and buying packs after release so that i would have almost all the good cards from the beginning. I knew that i was sending my money to a bunch of as******, but i was addicted and every month i was struggling to get as high in legend ranks as i could (i rarely was getting in top 1000 but i was trying). I kinda wanted to quit but i couldn't.
A windows then opened when TFT came out (very nice game). I managed to fill my time with it and take a break from hearthstone and that was enough to completely force myself to not go pack to paying money to a bunch of as******. Even after a new expansion and a new adventure i am still not interested.

That is my plan also for wow. At the moment i am too  addicted to classic. Its awesome. But like it always happens, i will take a break from it. Be it in 6 months, or 10 months, or even a year, i always take a break from wow and this time i will force myself to not come back because this s**t has gone too far.

I am truly sorry i am not able to quit dead turkey. Might be that blizzard is thinking of this when they make controversial decisions. But, in some months time, when my addiction will wear out a bit, even though the statistics will probably not show it, my quitting of the game will be because of all the stupid and money hungry decisions and i will not start a blizzard game ever again.

3490,Not quite sure what I should be doing around level 30,"Note: This is my first time playing classic and probably the furthest I’ve ever gotten into wow in general

I recently hit level 30 as alliance and started trying to go to some new zones. Originally I went to STV because it seemed like the logical place to go after Duskwood. I was able to do only 2 quests there until immediately after I’m being given quests where I have to fight things that are like 5-6 levels above me (not to mention the horde ganks from skull levels). I’m able to kill them, it just takes a long time and I’m thinking there has to be a more efficient place to level. 

So I start checking out other zones like Arathi and Hillsbrad (Hillsbrad’s higher level quests helped a bit but it wasn’t nearly enough) but the same thing kept on happening, I just get quests that are like level 35-38 immediately after one that’s something like 31 or 32. I’m very confused by this because I feel like every zone leading up to this was paced very well when it came to leveling and you always had something to do that was your level. But now it’s just looking like the only things I’m gonna be able to do are grind mobs or dungeons. I’m fine with a bit of grind for a quest but when it comes to brain dead grinding just to be able to do quests where you grind some more it becomes really tedious. 

So basically what I’m asking here is 

1. Am I doing something extremely wrong?

2. If not, is this just something that happens around level 30 and will it get better as I go?

I’d also like to mention that this isn’t gonna stop me from playing the game because I really want to hit 60, I’m enjoying this game very much, I’ve just hit a pretty big bump here.",1570621889.0,"Not quite sure what I should be doing around level 30Note: This is my first time playing classic and probably the furthest I’ve ever gotten into wow in general

3493,"[Paladin] How well does Holy/Reck, or Holy/Ret work at 60 ?"," I'm getting really close to 60, and I'm still undecided which talent build to go with at max level.

 Basically, I want to heal in pve, and dps in pvp. I know that the only way to get into a raid, is to be a healer, and I have no problem with that. But at the same time, I want to be able to 1v1 and kill people in wpvp, so a full 31 point Holy build doesn't really appeal to me. The two specs that I've had in mind are:

- [Holy/Reck (25/26/0)](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVAu0goZVGucczx) - this build is not really set in stone, like I could take points from *Spiritual Focus* and put them in *Improved LoH*. But basically, I wanted to get Reckoning for pvp, but also bring more utility to the raid by having *Blessing of Kings* and *Blessing of Sanctuary* (which I know all tanks love).


- [Holy/Ret (20/0/31)](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuoxZZvb0trcqo) - this is a more pvp oriented build, by going full Ret. This is also more or less the build that I've been leveling with, and so far, I've had no problems healing dungeons with only 20 points in Holy, but I know that that might not be enough for raids.

3495,"Duskwood of Herod, Well Played. Sincerely, your Ganker.","Im a bored lvl 53 Tauren warrior as of writing - and i decided to gank

When i decide to gank i dont just simply gank, i usually make rules to my ganking, allow there to be surprises for myself and provide opportunity for gankers to team up/""win"" - rarely happens though. This time was different.

I just spent the last 30 minutes walking around Raven Hill (actual walking) in duskwood like some demon, terrorizing lvl 25-30s. Lots of groups out, so plenty of opportunity for them to team up, and me to kill. 

At first, allies were unsure of my motive - some came near me thinking i was harmless since i didnt charge - Wam. Bam. Blap. Dead. 

Some had their backs turned as they fought other mobs.  Wam. Bam. Blap. Dead. 

Individuals tried to fight back. Wam. Bam. Blap. Dead.

I lurked and I lurked, but they became aware of me and my motive. They tried avoiding me. 

Finally, one group which had been very aware for the most part, a group of 5, foolishly went into a dead end catacomb. I waited at the entrance - making no secret of my presence. 

As the 5 were leaving, they saw me, knew who i was (and i knew them), and fled further into the catacomb. 

The chase was on - anticipation built as I began to walk further in. 

One poor individual not in the grp i was chasing had thier back turned to me, and was promptly killed - the others watched, but decided run rather than fight. 

I walked and walked, further into the catacomb. 

I came to a doorway, heard the all too familiar stealth sound, even saw the lvl 20-something. But as i went to strike him he sapped me, it didnt last long, but just enough for him and his buddies to flee. I got one hit on one of thier party as i got unsapped but i was frost novad in my spot, and couldnt berserk charge (only charge i allowed myself). 

They escaped. 

Smart play, but it didnt end there. 

I slogged out of the catacomb, and got on thier trail once again. They understood completely the mechanics of my game, and were kiting me as they killed the mobs they needed... but eventually i caught thier warlock who got cocky and slowed by a mob, and then they counter struck in force. 

Not only did this group of 5 decide to stand and fight for their friend, all the other low levels within eye shot came to help piling in on me. I whirlwinded, I mortal striked, i killed a few, but they overwhelmed me and took me out. 

When i resurrected they were still around my body, i clapped, they cheered, and i left. Content provided for both sides - best way to gank.

Well played Duskwood, well played.

Part of it is we are playing a different game, in that lots of talent changes, gear improvements and changes to dungeons and encounters has made lots of content easier.

The other factor is current players benefit from accumulated knowledge from years people spent learning and theorycrafting the best way to gear, spec and play each class. Not to mention the in depth knowledge of all the encounters.

And the quality and range of mods available again make the game easier to play.

But will Black Wing Lair be the same?  By the time it was released we were basically playing with the same build of the game with all the associated gear and talent improvements.  So that will mean we will be encountering BWL with the same tools as we did back in vanilla.

So will the added complexity of the encounters and dps checks prove as difficult as they felt back when it was released? Or will we be seeing 30 man pug raids clearing bwl? 

And what about AQ40 and Naxx?",1570615899.0,"So Classic content has been pretty easy so far... will BWL be the same?So it’s clear that classic wow has been a lot easier than the game felt in vanilla.

Part of it is we are playing a different game, in that lots of talent changes, gear improvements and changes to dungeons and encounters has made lots of content easier.

3619,What are some things from future installments of WoW that you miss in classic?,"I wanna make it clear that I love Classic and I am not at all advocating changing it as that can prove to be a slippery slope. However, nothing is perfect so I thought it could be interesting to talk about what you see as actual improvements made to the game after classic.



1. Arena - my favourite type of PvP in WoW so naturally I miss that in classic



2. Small (emphasis on ""small"") QoL improvements like training dummies for weapon skill in big cities and summoning stones for dungeons. Since you still need at least 2-3 players at the dungeon to summon I don't think this is a bad addition. Another thing that would be nice would be a build-in function for all the shit we get add-ons for anyway like quest item vendor prices, damage meters, in-depth stat overview for things like hit cap etc.



3. This one might be unpopular, but I miss the achievement system. It would of course have to be purely cosmetic for stuff like titles, tabards and mounts, or maybe just as a simple tracker with no rewards other than an arbitrary point system to see what/how much you have achieved and perhaps compare it to your friends. I don't know how achievements work in retail since I quit during Cata, but as a completionist I loved it in WotLK.



4. Dual specc. Again, this might be unpopular but I think this was a great addition as changing spec constantly gets ridiculously expensive and since some classes have to change specs all the time to farm, pvp etc it seems kinda unfair and unbalanced. A way of implementing dual spec to stay true to the classic spirit could be to only make dual spec available at level 60 and come with hefty one time fee to be paid to your trainer (Like 200g or something, idk). And of course you'd still have to pay if you decide to respec anyway.

Again, this might be unpopular but I think this was a great addition as changing spec constantly gets ridiculously expensive and since some classes have to change specs all the time to farm, pvp etc it seems kinda unfair and unbalanced. A way of implementing dual spec to stay true to the classic spirit could be to only make dual spec available at level 60 and come with hefty one time fee to be paid to your trainer (Like 200g or something, idk). And of course you'd still have to pay if you decide to respec anyway.

3620,Tough decision regarding race/faction,"Hello everyone. I am a new player to WoW universe, never played retail. I'm currently playing a Rogue for the Alliance. Honestly Horde seemed more appealing to me, but most of my friends wanted Alliance, so all of us went for it. I've seen videos throughout the years related to WoW and I really liked the Blood Elf race. I've done a check to learn more about it and I saw that this race will be introduced in the next expansion TBC for the Horde side. Because Blizzard didn't announce if they will make Faction change available until TBC is released, I'll have to delete my Alliance character and start all over again from level 1 as a Horde if I'm willing to play Blood Elf in the upcoming expansion.
I was thinking about deleting it right now and moving on my own to Horde. By the time TBC will be released, I'll have a guild and money to make my life easier.


I am asking you guys what is the best option in this situation? Should I keep playing on the Alliance character and pray that Blizzard will introduce faction change or delete it right now and start all over again on the horde side for the whole duration of Classic, then I can easily chance race or create a new Blood Elf from level 1?",1570606169.0,"Tough decision regarding race/factionHello everyone.

3705,NEW Crit Chance Calculation! - Weapon Skill/Agility Relationship,"Hi Reddit,

I was trying to make an excel spreadsheet to calculate crit chance, but I noticed the numbers were off. I then started messing around with my low dagger skill and noticed something strange. Tested at lvl 60 with a human warrior.

It is commonly reported that 1 weapon skill = 0.04% crit chance. What actually happens is that levelling your weapon skill by 1 lowers the agility threshold you have to reach for agility to contribute to your crit chance. At weapon skill 1, the threshold is 240 agility. At weapon skill 300, that threshold drops to 0 agility.

The way this works is each weapon skill lowers the threshold by 0.8 agility. As 20 agility = 1% crit, or 1 agility = 0.05% crit, this gives the impression that raising your weapon skill increases your crit by 0.04%. This was done by equipping and unequipping agility gear at 175 dagger skill, where 100 was found to be the threshold, and again at 180 dagger skill, where 96 became the new threshold. Each agility point above the threshold increased crit chance by 0.05%, and below agility contributed no crit chance at all. 

Above 300 weapon skill, the threshold appears to go negative, whereby each weapon skill point above 300 gives you 0.04% crit chance. With most people running around with max weapon skill, your base agility masks how this formula actually works, but for those of you with low weapon skill at lvl 60 this might illuminate some things for you.

TL;DR Weapon Skill doesn't increase crit chance, it lowers the agility threshold above which agility can contribute to crit chance.
**1 Weapon skill = 0.8 agility lower = 0.04% crit chance.**
If your weapon skill is low enough, even your agility won't give you crit chance!

Thanks for reading!

**EDIT:** This threshold appears to change with each level. While that formula will take too much time for me to figure out, I have noticed on my lvl 28 priest that the agility threshold is 41. It could be true that the threshold increases by roughly 6.2 each level, but is a very important warning that weapon skill, if low enough affects critical chance as well as other stats, as your agility threshold will be too high to benefit from your agility gear.",1570598222.0,"NEW Crit Chance Calculation! - Weapon Skill/Agility RelationshipHi Reddit,

3741,Some tips for dealing with your WoW addiction/Combining it with the adult life,"I noticed myself struggling with regulating my playtime. Here are some tips that help me not getting to lost in the world. 

# 1. Mindset is everything

I remind myself that my character will not disappear when i log out . When i can only play for 2 hours, i don't try to do as much as i can in those 2 hours. I just play like i would when i could play for 12 hours. Once the time is up, i stop doing what i was doing. I'll pick it up from there next time. This makes me way more relaxed when playing and make me less bummed out when ""my time is up"".

# 2. It actually is just a game

It is a cliche but for me it is important to remind myself of. Yesterday i logged in to my retail account after 2 years and it is weird how valueless my characters feels for me. It is the memories I have of them that are valuable but the characters them self? Not so much.

# 3. Try to not play it daily

By taking breaks for a couple of days now and again, I don't get sucked into a rhythm. Then when I finally log back in, I enjoy it even more. Also, building up that sweet rested xp ;)

# 4. Set a timer

A lot of time i set a timer for a few hours. Even though I don't always stick to it, it still is a more conscious choice than when I don't set a timer.

# 5. Parental control

When all above does not help, you could consider letting a friend, your partner or anyone to setup parental control. You can set daily and weekly limits, weekly playtime reports and even schedule every hour of the week. This may seem childish or weak but if the addiction really gets out of control this will be a last resort before just outright deleting the game. You can set it up [here](https://us.battle.net/account/parental-controls/setup.html) (or [here for eu people](https://eu.battle.net/account/parental-controls/setup.html)).

3778,Why don't hunters pull anymore?,"I've run a bunch of dungeons, and way back in the day when Vanilla was live, we always had the hunter do the pulling in order to do split pulls, as shown in the video I'm linking below. It split packs up and made some really hard packs (like in UBRS) a relative cakewalk. The tank could charge in and take aggro as the hunter was feigning death, instead of trying to pull the pack themselves. It was great on long pulls where you want to kite the mobs to a specific spot in the dungeon. It did take a competent hunter who knew what he was doing to pull it off, and some coordination between the hunter and the tank, but nothing that would make it impossible for two people on discord to pull off, or even in text chat if they knew what they were doing.

I'm just a lowly healer, with no in depth knowledge of these things, but I have very distinct memories of my hunter buddy doing this in 2006.

Is anyone using hunters this way? Or has everyone collectively agreed that the tank just pulls?

Video demonstrating how it works:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm4pSMLvxLI",1570592252.0,"Why don't hunters pull anymore?I've run a bunch of dungeons, and way back in the day when Vanilla was live, we always had the hunter do the pulling in order to do split pulls, as shown in the video I'm linking below. It split packs up and made some really hard packs (like in UBRS) a relative cakewalk. The tank could charge in and take aggro as the hunter was feigning death, instead of trying to pull the pack themselves. It was great on long pulls where you want to kite the mobs to a specific spot in the dungeon. It did take a competent hunter who knew what he was doing to pull it off, and some coordination between the hunter and the tank, but nothing that would make it impossible for two people on discord to pull off, or even in text chat if they knew what they were doing.

I'm just a lowly healer, with no in depth knowledge of these things, but I have very distinct memories of my hunter buddy doing this in 2006.

Is anyone using hunters this way? Or has everyone collectively agreed that the tank just pulls?

The warrior had apparently taken offense at being sheeped, and charged me. He caught me off guard and I was at half pretty quick, but us mages are a slippery bunch, I CoC into frost nova, then blink away laughing. He was persistent however, and I ended up getting chased almost all the way to Stonard before he decided it wasn’t worth it.

Moral of the story: sometime people just be tryin to help mon.

TLDR: sheeped a warrior to heal him and he didn’t appreciate it",0

3874,Druid still able to be mana drained in animal forms,"Hey all,

A common misconception is that Druid can be mana drained inside of their Cat/Bear form in Vanilla, and this is simply not true. I believe the misconception comes from people noticing mana dips when we come back out of the form, but it’s due to forms costing so much mana, not being mana drained.

Currently in Classic WoW, Viper Sting and any mana drain is draining Druids mana in any form which is ruining some matchups for Druid, trivializing the 1v1s.

Patch 1.4 - 
Viper Sting - This spell can no longer be used on warrior and rogue targets. In addition, while it can be used on a druid target at any time it will only drain mana when the druid is in caster form.

It’s unfortunately difficult to get this to attention due to the lack of Druids voicing this and the misconception of how it’s supposed to work in the first place.",1570584397.0,"Druid still able to be mana drained in animal formsHey all,

3880,"Blizzard, on behalf of ""casuals"", please slow down","I know this probably won't get much attention, as it is very unlikely to create any outrage. Because it is, in fact, a positive post and they're not in fashion lately, but let me try anyway.

Blizzard, with the latest news of opening Dire Maul this soon, made it look like the timeline of Classic moves and will move very fast. 

But I just want to speak up and let everyone know, that there is plenty of us, who don't even have level 60 yet. We're probably not the typical Reddit users, we're not the typical Reddit posters even more. But there is a lot of us.

I personally am not even level 40. I am from the demographic of the original players who played WoW back in time and absolutely loves the game, as it helped (for some it's maybe pathetic, but it's true) shape my childhood/teenage years. Now though, adult life and adult responsibilities are coming and there is simply not that much time for WoW anymore. I'm not advocating for making the game less time consuming, or less ""hardcore"". *I love the game as it is*. Just for slower release plan. I expect WoW: Classic to last, and last long. I don't want it to be ""over"" in few months. This is one of the things that excite me about WoW: Classic - it's there to stay for a long time and everything will not be invalidated in the next patch. But I don't want to hit fresh 60 when Phase 5 is rolling out and I would be so far behind.

Now, we're at 42 days since launch that is around 1,4 levels per day. That's a lot! Even calculating the first 20 or so fast levels.

Average players spends around 8 days (? someone correct me if not true) /played. That averages around 4.5 (!) hours per day to hit 60 around now. Which is close to impossible for a regular working dude with other hobbies/responsibilities. 

But let me just say it - I don't mind it! I don't mind that it takes so long. The leveling is fun and I'll gladly spend months doing it. 

Although there is a lot of us like this and I would like the content-release schedule to be at least a bit in accordance with these human options, and not caring *only* about those who race to level 60 spending 12 hours a day playing, getting ahead of 99% of playerbase and then (although I didn't hear *anyone* actually say this) say that there is ""no content"".

I realize that hardcore players are the moving engine of the game and they should *absolutely* be catered to (and mad respect to them), but not *only them* and not when *nobody is asking for it*. And it's (I think) sometimes hard to hear the rest of the players. Moreover, I think Activision's HQ is pressing to push new content as fast as possible to keep the timeline moving and the ""engagement numbers"" up, but I think it's very unnecessary.

But as I said in the beginning, this is supposed to be a positive post. Because otherwise (or including) Blizzard is killing it! Everything, and I mean *everything* they've done with Classic and for us, the Classic community, has been fantastic (and that's coming from someone who played Vanilla and was fan of Vanilla as long as even TBC rolled out) so far. 

I just wanted to voice that there is a lot of us who appreciate it and enjoy it, but are not vocal very often, and are not part of the 10% hardcore players. 

PS: I realize the title is not the best, as I can't in fact speak for anyone else and all this is my opinion and viewpoint. But the response for the post will help clearing that up, whom it concerns and whom it doesn't.

edit PPS: Also the title is a bit sensationalist, I apologize for that

edit2: **The issue is not DM itself, DM is mostly fine.

We run this a few times until our druid speaks up. ""I need Rocco"" ( think i spelt that right) Our tank says NP and goes on his way.

No one being an asshole or impatient, We were just there for the adventure. Its hard to get that now a days specially in classic cause everyone wants to be some sort of elitist...

I’ve always loved and had a thing for protection Paladins though, but was put off my what is a very hard road if you want to be in a decent raid guild that didn’t really improve until TBC.

I always assume everyone’s goals are gear up and raid but WoW is an amazing game that lets you set your own goals and playstyle.

So for you personally what are you hoping to do and play like?",0

Then I was thinking alchemy since resource prices are so low I could buy the supplies and make potions for profit.

But I'm also thinking of enchanting both for myself and so I could dust bad higher level greens. But I could just make a level 5 alt to disenchant.

3929,Druid life at 60 so far,"Hey all!

Before I get into this I want to quickly explain my background with Vanilla. I raided on a mage through MC/Ony/BWL/ZG and hated it. More recently I leveled a Druid to 60 and PvPd on a Pserver but little else. That aside....

So I just hit 60 recently as a Druid, and I’m surprised at how Druid end game feels compared to mage. To put it simply, I’m always doing stuff. I have no down time and it’s amazing and my guild has likely realized how useful a Druid is.

What do I mean by this? Well I’m their only Druid. They don’t understand it. I can do everything. LBRS needs a tank? I’ll go. UBRS needs a healer? Yep I’m NS HOTW I’ll go. Guild needs another LBRS, I’ll tank that. I’m actually confusing my guildies. I can fit into any role and it feels great. I can experience any content whenever I want because I fill the missing role.

On my mage once I was in a dungeon it was fun. But a dungeon consisted of finding 2 Dps, then the long slog to find a healer, and eventually a tank. Maybe even paying a tank. Group disban? Damn I think I’m done for the night. I had so much down time just making groups I sighed any time I picked up a dungeon quest.

That’s all.

I play on Sulfuras - Horde and I'm just curious what the west coast PvP servers are like.

Of note, we typically stop dots at 45%, burn her to 40%, and ALL dps and healing stops during the landing phase while 3 tanks frantically burn everything to try and get aggro.

3991,I just left the guild I built,"I came into WoW with friends from other games and was asked to help run a guild as I had done so before. We exploded past 300 members in no time. I had been recruiting members setting up raid structure, loot structure, discord, and running every officer meeting until yesterday...

Yesterday while running a dungeon with the GM he decided he would pull mobs as a DPS. When I did get to pull he would AoE after I had only 1 hit on the marked target. I tried to explain threat, only to hear him say, “Yes well this is a speed run and you need to learn your class. You’re the only tank I’ve ever had an issue with so this is your problem. You’re just not good at tanking.” It was aggravating that someone could be so arrogant as to think they could just pull or AoE 1-2 seconds into a pull and that I would have 100% aggro on all packs and that they had no responsibility in the matter. This went on for 20-30 minutes and only one boss kill. I told them I couldn’t do the run as I needed to calm down after being told I was trash for the first time as a tank by someone I gamed with for years. I disconnected from discord and received a flurry of insults from the GM about how it’s not his fault I’m trash and don’t know my class. I asked him to stop messaging me so I could cool down only for him to spam me more...

/gquit 

I hated to do it but knew I had to. I put in more of my personal time building the guild and developing friendships with guild mates than anyone else. I was instantly banned from discord. Of the 33 who were online I received messages from 21 members wanting to know what happened and where I was going. A slew of people messages me wanting to follow me. It’s reassuring that so many people saw me leave and cared enough to message me.

Now I have the screen showing no guild... I’m debating if it’s best to start a guild myself or roll the dice on the million options out there.

Thanks for reading the rant, just needed to get that out.

Tl;dr As the Co-GM I built and ran a guild only to have the GM rage out on me during a dungeon. Now I’m guildless and debating to start one or join one.

Edit: I just wanted to thank everyone for the comments and discussion. I’ve got an incredible group of friends who helped me decide to create a guild and many quality players who came with.

3997,Completely Resetting Keybinds / Action Bars at 60 - Need Advice,"I am nearing the completion of the leveling of my first 60 in classic, and am looking back at some of the novice errors I've made while leveling and wanted to make sure I've set myself up for success going forward.

I am closing in on 60 with a ret pally and will be respeccing into holy shortly, as was always my plan. While doing this, I figured it was a very good time to get my bars set up in a much better fashion as I will only have to go through one period of effectively relearning to play the class, instead of 2 to get rid of the muscle memory I've established in the leveling process. 

I'm looking for advice and pitfalls I should keep in mind while setting up these bars. Below is a bit of a summary of things I've already come across on my own (or maybe added as an edit from the comments). 

1.  Use macros - setting up mouse over healing macros with Shift/Ctrl for downranked versions of the heals.  
2. Unbind Q, E, C, and R, to use these along with F and G for actions as these are convenient, easy to reach, buttons for which are better used in combat situations.  Mouse scroll (up / down) and mouse buttons should also be used.
3. Set up one bar for questing / farming.  Set up another bar for raid healing. Set up another for dungeon healing. Don't be afraid of any overlap that may occur. 
4. Find a way to manage gear sets / weapons / trinkets. (Using parts from 1 and 2)
5.  Find a way to keybind emergency buttons in a spot that's quick to hit, but somewhere you won't accidentally use it. (Bubble and Divine Intervention - I'm looking at you!)

4016,Classic+ Suggestions,"Just some quality of life and common sense suggestions. With a fun one tossed in. I'm sure I'll get flayed alive by some by merely suggesting changes to classic, that said here are my ideas:

1. Randomize Devilsour and Black Lotus spawn points and timers. - Everyone knows where these creatures/herbs spawn. Those spawn points are virtually always camped. A simple solution the private servers started was adding additional random spawn points and more randomized spawn times. 

2. Killing a mob should give the player who killed priority for skinning. - I feel like this is common sense, but if you get the tag and kill the creature you should get priority on skinning it. People hiding in corpses or just waiting around to jack someones item is shitty. The player who tagged could already choose not to loot the item guaranteeing no one will get the skin, they should also have the option to skin it before any one else.

3. Have queue times based on faction imbalance. If one faction has more than 60% of the characters on the server, which means the other faction has less than 40% of the characters, the outnumbered faction should get priority on wait times. 

4. Add the option to purchase duel spec. - This really helps out some of the weaker classes that are pigeon holed into one role. It allows people to have a pvp spec and a dungeon/raid spec. 

5. Factions such as 'Wildhammer clan' have reputation but no bonuses. Give these factions a 100% speed mount purchased at the same price as common dwarf mounts, but unlike the common 100% movement speed rams that have armor, these mounts would be the original unarmored skin. These 100% mounts without armor were in vanilla, but they were replaced around patch 1.12 so it is not possible to get them this time around. I think it should be possible to get them at the cost of the players time.

I was ganked no less than 10-15 times within an hour while attempting to quest between Lakeshire and Stormwind. I'm level 19 and these were what I assume is level 60 (there were two groups of two). Is this normal PVP gameplay (for all or most servers) or was this just a special case of assholes? I continued along for the first 20-30 minutes and then I could no longer escape them. They were killing everyone, including the gate guards at Stormwind with immunity. I'm 100% ok with world pvp and a fair-ish fight any day of the week but this is not that at all. After dying 4-5 times at the entrance to Stormwind a random level 60 Hunter finally showed up and was trying to fight them but all he could do was harass them.

4048,Hunter Questions,"I like the idea of hunters but I don't want to get ridiculously in depth with some of the aspects of the class like pet taming, melee weaving, etc. or have to spend every single moment concentrating just to keep my pet from doing stupid things like wiping the group so I have a few questions about how they play.

1. Do you ever feel like the class is too mechanically intense? For example, having to constantly manage your Auto Shot, your position, your pet and whatever else compared to another class that has a simpler rotation and/or no pet?
2. Do you ever feel like the class is a chore? Similar to the previous question, you have to constantly control basic things like who your pet is attacking in both PvE and PvP. Then you also have out of combat things such as food/ammo/bag space.
3. Do you need to use crafted ammo in PvP? My understanding is that you generally use the vendor ammo except on bosses in PvE.
4. How difficult is PvE kiting? Is it just a case of keep aggro, don't get hit and know where you need to run or do you need to do more complex things with aspects/traps?
5. How punishing would you say the class is in PvP for the average player? There are many people who will say that the skill floor is quite a bit higher than other classes and that something like a mage is much more intuitive to play.
6. How lazy can you be with taming/traning pets? So, if I just want an ordinary cat for PvP, something like a wolf for PvE and something suitable for solo farming, can I get these without having to tame loads of random things just for the higher rank pet skills?
7. How many essential macros do you have at 60? I assume scatter/FD/trap but what else?
8. Do you have many more keybinds compared to other classes?

4099,Hearthstone placement at Level 60 (Alliance),"I've been searching for topics about the most optimal Hearthstone placement on a maximum level (non-mage) Alliance character, but didn't find much.

Menethil Harbor seems like a decent choice due to being the closest Eastern Kingdoms spot for Kalimdor hops (to even 2 locations), one being close to Onyxia and later AQ, while being in close proximity to a capital (Ironforge). Blackrock Mountain and later Naxx are also in convenient fight distance.The downsides are the lack of trade chat, bank, and auction house.

Another strong alternative could be Ironforge, which is a bit further away from ships to Kalimdor, while having nearly the same strategic location for raids as Menethil. Trade chat, bank, and AH are present.

It seems to me the main difference is the tradeoff between the proximity to Kalimdor ships vs the convenience of the auction house, bank, and trade chat.

Am I missing something else here?

You can chain mobs and keep your mana almost at maximum just following those steps :

1. Searing and stoneskin totems

2. Auto attack/Windfurry low speed 2H

3. Flame shock is the only shock I use for mana efficiency and I only use it when I'm at a minimum of 90% mana left.

5. Heal if needed after few mobs considering that you don't need to be at 100% health, 60% is enough to grind.

It is really mana efficient and while doing this you avoid loosing time drinking. Also, you keep killing mobs at a decent speed.

4139,Lag when switching Zones,"Hello guys, having some trouble with Classic WoW.

When I switch zones (e.g from Lakeshire to Redridge Canyons) I get some input/network lag, I don't understand what is causing it as it never used to happen. It is very frustrating as obviously in some areas you switch in an out of zones very often.

I thought the problem started since I downloaded the ""Move Anything"" and ""BuffWatch"" addon's and made a new simple seal of righteousness macro, so I removed all my addons an renamed the cache, interface and WTF folders to cacheOld, interfaceOld and WTFOld, restarted WoW, deleted the ""Old"" files and placed my addons back in the new ones it created.

Thanks in advance!",1570562979.0,"Lag when switching ZonesHello guys, having some trouble with Classic WoW.

When I switch zones (e.g from Lakeshire to Redridge Canyons) I get some input/network lag, I don't understand what is causing it as it never used to happen. It is very frustrating as obviously in some areas you switch in an out of zones very often.

I thought the problem started since I downloaded the ""Move Anything"" and ""BuffWatch"" addon's and made a new simple seal of righteousness macro, so I removed all my addons an renamed the cache, interface and WTF folders to cacheOld, interfaceOld and WTFOld, restarted WoW, deleted the ""Old"" files and placed my addons back in the new ones it created.

In the open world I've been using ThreatPlates and ClassicCastbars to easily see what's being cast by enemies and allies (with ClassicCastbars showing a castbar under my target's portrait and ThreatPlates showing them under allies' nameplates).

This can be dangerous when I'm tanking dungeons as, when I'm at 2% health or so, I need to know if my healer's about to get a cast off.

I find it hard to blame WoW classic for my deaths cause I hardly come to a point were I can say ""Yup I used everything in my arsenal, couldn't be done"". I know i'm not an expert on the game and the mechanics, and thats exactly why I can be mad. Everytime I die I reflect on my my actions and in most cases i comes down to that either I didn't use everything in my power to survive/win or I didnt use my abilities correctly ( I sometimes panic in PvP). Don't get me wrong, i'm a very emotional player, but having completed many challenging games in my life both PvP and PvE I've come to a point that in order for me to become a better player I have to swallow my pride and realise.... I fucking suck. And its at that point you will have the right mindset to rise! Or give up xD

I play as a mage and I know mages are very slippery, a glass cannon albeit, but with many tricks and tools to turn the tables.

4204,Statquestion for Druid Healer running dungeons (Chosing an item),"Hey reddit,

I have a question regarding what stats I should focus on while leveling my druid.  
Currently I am fully heal specialized and run alot of dungeons for leveling.  


I have a staff with +15 int, +7 stam, +10 spirit and just gained a staff with +10 int, +10 stam and +21 to healing effects and spells. My thought is that the manareg is less attractive than flat heal gain- but I am not sure if that's correct at all.  


Can someone guide me as to how I can do the math myself? Or just give me a rule of thumb for choosing my items? :)  


I hope I'm posting according to the rules of the subreddit!

4205,Which DPS Warrior build works best for 5-man dungeons and raids?,"I finally reached level 60 and started working on my  pre-raid BiS gear. In the next month, I'll be running a lot of 5-man dungeons, but also raids. My current spec is Arms (31/20) and I really like the Sweeping Strikes AoE damage, but single target DPS isn't that great.  At this point of the game, since gear is limited, I'm not really feeling like going classic Dual Wield Fury spec because I believe it's more gear dependent than Arms or 2H Fury.

4236,What should I main based on playstyle?,"I know, I know, there are a billion posts like this out there, but hear me out.

I, for the life of me, cannot decide which class to main. I have played Vanilla till level 30 back in the day and that's about it. Never played retail or the other addons.

I see most guides talk about how ""good"" the class is at certain aspects of the game. I couldn't care less. Every class brings something to the table, so for example I wouldn't mind not being top DPS.

Based on my playstyle and characters I choose in other games, which classes would you recommend?

&#x200B;

* Not the mechanically best player. In Overwatch, CS:GO or LoL I never choose characters that are mechanically intense like Tracer, Genji, Assassins/ADC in LoL. I pick something like Nasus, Garen, Swain in LoL and Reinhard or Zenyatta in OW. In CS:GO I always was more of a support/leader player.
* I like to rely on thinking and strategy rather than pure mechanics.
* I don't care about topping charts.
* I do not like healing in WoW, as all the videos I have watched, people are just clicking on nameplates.
* I want to both PVE and PVP.
* I don't like endless farming and running dungeons a million times, except raids.
* Classes I don't want to play based on mechanics or class fantasy: Paladin (nameplate clicker, buff bot), Priest (nameplate clicker), Druid (nameplate clicker), Hunter (kiting, auto-shot weaving), Rouge (I hate stealth in all games).
* Classes I would consider playing: Warlock, Mage, Warrior.

I have leveled a Warlock to 28 and it's been easy. I am not 100% sold on the pet mechanics (especially in PVP) and dungeons were super boring, where I would basically just apply some dots and send my pet in, then wand everything to death.

Mage seems quite fun, but also rather one dimensional?

Warrior: I like the thought of tanking, but I read that tanks require a much bigger time investment to gear up and yeah there is the leveling experience. Have a warrior at level 9 atm.

I play around 10-20 hours a week.

&#x200B;

EDIT: After trying lots of different classes and leveling them to around 10-15 I decided to go back to my warlock and am now at peace of mind. At least now I know how the other classes play on a basic level and can say that I liked warlock the most.

[This is a RP PVP server. I went to orgimar first.](https://reddit.com/link/dewdxt/video/oi1hysxlj9r31/player)

***AUDIO in the video IS BAD AND UNEDITED and was made at 3 clock in the morning***

This is my Toon **Wilstone**, he is on a quest to *get his pants back from the horde.*

This all started in White Run when he woke up and found his pants were gone, he asked around the town and gnome said the horde took them. 

Enraged by this Wilstone did what any sane person would do 

**1.get drunk.** 

**2.get on a ship.**

 **3. visit all the horde capitals and ask them for my pants back.**

You know.... like any sane dwarf would do.

this was a lot of fun and I made a lot of buds along the way. I'm making a full video on this later. 

My last stop I need to make.... Thunder Bluff.

4258,Is Reckoning dead?,"Hi guys.

&#x200B;

Pretty casual player here, I'm a lvl 37 Dwarven Paladin.

I've been looking at a lot of builds for the Pala to try to maximize the hybrid potential of the class (I don't want to end up just being a healbot, at least not all the time). I like the idea of the ""warrior priest"" (of the Warhammer universe), getting in the heat with a big hammer and throwing heals, cleanses and blessings here and there along the way.

For that, I've been looking at the Holy Reckoning build (and other builds featuring the reckoning talent). However, most of these guides were made before launch of Classic, and it seems the Reckoning talent is working quite differently in Classic than on the Private servers where these builds were made and tested. In essence, on private servers you could stack reckoning hits with the /sit macro and save them for a ""reckoning bomb"". In Classic, Reckoning basically just resets youro swing timer (I don't care for using a /stopattack macro to utilize this, I just wanna play the game and keep swinging).

My question is: is Reckoning still a valid talent to build your toon for, as a melee healer that can take a hit, keep your party topped up and also deliver a hit once in a while?

Appreciate any thoughts - also regarding other builds with the same aim!

4320,Totem dismiss macro in classic.,"Hi,

So, someone told me that it is possible to dismiss totems in classic by macro. The person went offline and I didn't add him/her to friends so I can't ask about more info.

Tried to google the stuff, but I found only macro that destroys fire totems. It works, I checked.

>!/run if not UnitAffectingCombat(""player"") then dt1 = dt1 or CreateFrame(""Button"", ""dt1"", UIParent, ""SecureUnitButtonTemplate"")dt1:SetAttribute(""type2"", ""destroytotem"")dt1:SetAttribute(""\*totem-slot\*"",1)end!<

>!/click dt1 RightButton!<

Does anyone have something similar for other totems or is good with macros and is able to edit this one for other totems? I am too dumb to do that and I don't even know what these commands do. All I know is that 1st you have to run the macro out of combat to work in combat.

I was in a UBRS group tonight, and it all comes down to that we kill the beast, and i skin him, and get the epic hide. It goes for 300g.

Immediately my group says that you normally roll for the skin.

So i tell them, fine. If you can put your Finkle's knife in ""Cannot be traded"" window, i know that you'd be able to skin it too, and i'll roll with you. The other guys who was able to did it. And the rest of the group started linking it, like i am stupid or something.

I tell them, don't link it. put it in cannot be traded so i know you have it. They wasn't able to and said that we all had to roll for the skin. 

Am i wrong for disagreeing with that?

I can see why i should roll with the other skinners, but i don't wanna roll with someone who couldn't skin it anyway. Skinning rewards, should be for those who took the time to get the knife and level 300 skinning only.

It's the same if i am in BRD with someone and they mine dark iron, and i tell him that we have to roll for the ore EVEN THO I DON'T HAVE MINING. That would be ridicolus.

She ran all the way to Darnassus and explored the whole city which she thought was wicked cool.  I’m in the process now of trying to convince her to hearth back to the inn and have dinner.....but she keeps saying she wants to “just finish this quest”.   I’ve created a monster!

4390,Should I stick on Judgement (EU) server?,"When I created my character a couple of days ago, I decided to pick one which isn't 'high' population, because I didn't want to feel swarmed or deal with queue times. But I also *really* don't want to be playing a server that feels dead, I don't want to struggle to find people for dungeons, or battlegrounds, etc. I want to feel like I'm part of a bustling and active world.

It said Judgement server was 'medium' population. However, it now says it's low (I understand this can be due to how many people are actually logged on at any one time, and it's 2AM, so yanno). But, more than this, I haven't seen many players at all around Goldshire, and if my memory is correct that used to be a #1 spot for everyone to hang out and duel. There have been literally 0 people there over level 15 over the past couple days of playing.

Also, from what I've googled of it, there are a few people saying it's a 'dead' server.

Should I re-roll on a more populous server? I'm asking this now while I'm only at level 10 because I don't want to get to 60 and realise I made the wrong choice. Losing a couple days' playing time is something I can deal with.

So, here are my specific questions:

1. For anyone that knows, is Judgement 'dead'?
2. If so, is it likely to *stay* dead?
3. Should I switch to another server? And if so, should I go for high population?
4. How are queue times, now, on higher population servers? (If this isn't an issue like it was on launch, apparently, then maybe high pop would be better for what I'm looking for).

Thanks!

\[edit\]

Also, I'm not sure exactly how layering does/will affect all this, since I've heard they had to add layering to reduce queue times, but they're going to be removing it in the next phase.",1570525135.0,"Should I stick on Judgement (EU) server?When I created my character a couple of days ago, I decided to pick one which isn't 'high' population, because I didn't want to feel swarmed or deal with queue times.

Same for chests, if you see a chest in a camp that is a huge pain to pull and take the time to fight through to it, it'll have a lot of stuff in it, but if you saw it spawn in and go open it it has a few pieces of food.

4475,Using Owl in Dungeon Problem: Using the Pet Without Screech?,"I have become frustrated after leveling with my Owl since Level 10 now going into Scarlet Monastery.  Our group experienced problems with the Owl's primary exclusive ability of Screech, which does a great debuff.  However, we found the screech to have a really wide diameter and wound up aggroing way too many mobs that wasn't being aggroed otherwise.  We are level 34, which I thought was the real issue, but with the exception of perhaps Cathedral, it felt like Screech was the cause and not the level difference.

Thoughts?  Is this an issue with other Owl owners?  It saddens me to think I'm going to have to essentially change pets for dungeons as I really don't want to bring a pet in without its unique ability.  They all have benefits, and just having them bite/claw means I could just bring whatever in.

4478,Incredibly satisfying pseudo pvp experience,"So this happened a couple days ago on Blaumeaux (i'm a Horde player - rogue).

I was in the Hinterlands questing, and I came across a group of ally trying to kill the elite troll mob on top of the shrine, the 50 mob you get the mallet for ZF I think. There were like 4 of them and kind of struggling, so I ran up and started dps'ing the shit out of the elite mob. The mob is almost dead, and this fucking priest named Luther or something started attacking me who was a part of that group. So naturally, I get my one sinister strike in on him before I die. Needless to say, I was pissed. I'm fine with being attacked by a similar level ally if he doesn't kill me when i'm at <10% grinding mobs out in the world, but seriously, if it's this imbalanced and i'm HELPING YOU(!), then i'll have a hearty 'fuck you' waiting.

I never attack ally in general unless they attack first or are attacking other Horde (unless the horde guy is being a shitbag and I can see that), but a switch definitely flipped after this fucker killed me. So, I rez and follow them to Jin'Alathor or whatever it's called. I get all my skills ready, poison, heal, and waited for them to engage with some mobs. Found a nice opening, and starting unloading on that priest with everything I had; I almost kill him, but he holy shields and the other three starts to focus me, so I end up dying again. Pretty lame, but I was definitely on tilt and was determined to kill this guy. So I rez again, but to my surprise, I see all of their corpses in that spot - THE ELT MOBS FINISHED THEM ALL!

I normally don't pursue grudges like this because some unhappy, life-hating nerd isn't worth the time to kill when I could make money or grind (on top of the time they made me waste from the initial death) but it was so satisfying to see this result. they ended up rezzing after a bit, and must've rezzed on the next level up because I couldn't really find them quickly, so I ended up just leaving, but honestly it was satisfying enough that I didn't care to continue too much further (along with the fact that i'd probably have to die again if I wanted to kill any of them). This isn't the craziest kill and I'm not particularly good, but it was awesome taking a team down without any human help.

I'm spec'd into 5/5 ignite 3/3 flamestrike crit with 5/5 shatter 3/3 imp cone of cold and 3/3 permafrost

I nova, flamestrike (65% crit on frozen) cone of cold combo and kite to my 2nd nova flamestrike cone of cold (mobs usually dead by the 2nd combo). I finish my mob in about 20~25seconds with mana to spare. 

Never have much of a problem kiting them with 60% slow (run in a big circle or kite them backwards)

I always get heat from other mages, so I'm curious to see if there's anybody else out there that plays the same style I do (i feel like this is more fun than standing in one spot casting blizzard over and over)

Sunday it was happening every couple of minutes and became entirely unplayable, so I had to just give up and hope the issue would resolve itself within the next few days.

Me being a level 60 Mage who has 300 tailoring and the pattern for the Robe of Archmage, I rolled Need on it so I can transmute it since that's a cheaper and less frustrating way of getting Essences of Water and Air. Immediately after I got called out by the rogue saying ""Don't need on greens"" and the other one calling me a Ninja looter and the rest of the party soon decided to all roll Need on the Essences.

I'd understand if this was like a purple BoE item that's worth hundreds of gold and they could sell it and buy their own BiS piece with it, but the Essences of Undeath are like 80s each and unlike them wanting them just to sell I actually need them to make my own BiS chest, not even pre-bis or only for one or two phases, this chest is literally BiS until like p5 or something.  


So why is it that some people think they have the same right to roll on an item they just want to sell vs someone who actually needs the item and the only other way to obtain it is to grind mobs for days or weeks, or spend hundreds of gold.. 

What if instead of Essences of Undeath a Fire one dropped which goes for 40g? Does the increased value suddenly mean it's not okay for me to Need anymore because everyone could use that bit of gold or regardless of what the value is, Essences are off the table and no one has a right to need on them regardless of what purpose they need it for??  


I'm just tired of getting conflicting messages with some people saying it's fine and I should need on them since I actually need them and others saying I'm being a ninja looter and everyone should greed for them. 

I just want my robe already, okay? ;\_;",1570504822.0,"Can we please stop this?I thought it was already established and the general consensus for Need vs Greed is that you Need on an item you actually need (ie. it's an upgrade for you or you need it for your BiS), otherwise just greed.

4614,A Druid with an Identity Crisis,"Hello fellow WoW addicts. I am making a brief post because I am a bit lost and could use some guidance. 

I am torn about whether or not to stick to being a resto Druid getting into raiding or to give Feral a shot at 60. I found myself tanking many dungeons up until 48 and made the switch to Resto mainly due to fear of being irrelevant and unable to join raids. 

Throughout my journey I have had many people compliment me on my tanking (humble brag) while also mentioning that Druids usually suck (sad). Based on a lot of what I have read I made the decision to go back to Resto because I do enjoy it and I want to get serious about raiding at 60. 

I guess my question is, how successful can someone be tanking as a druid at 60? Most things I've seen say it's possible but most people don't do it and warriors are simply better. I for one love the challenge and that challenge alone drove me to tank up until ST.

4638,Help me settle a debate on Shadow Priest rotation,"Here is the rotation I've been using while leveling my priest:

Pre-fight: Power Word Shield, 
Start of fight: Shadow Word: Pain, 
Mind flay, 
As undead: get punched unlocking touch of weakness, 
Mind blast, 
Wand to death. 

The rotation suggested on the discord server I'm on is:

Pre-fight: Power word shield, 
Start of fight: mind blast, 
Shadow word pain, 
The rest matches above. 

I insist that my rotation is higher DPS for these reasons:
1) Starting SWP sooner means ticks sooner, means the mob dies sooner
2) By the time I use mind blast, my highest damage ability, I've added 3 stacks of shadow vulnerability by then (between SWP, MF, and ToW), making it hit 9% harder

The risk of my method is that since the first damage tick is 3 sec after I start fighting rather than 1.5 sec, I leave a 1.5 sec window for someone else to tag it. This, however, is offset by the fact that I get the mob to run at me IMMEDIATELY. And really I've used this rotation thousands of times now and I bet I only lost a mob like 5 or 10 times.

May not seem like a huge deal, but when you fight as many mobs as you fight in this game, that time seriously adds up.

4653,I'm sorry.,"First off, let me introduce myself. 

I am a level 60 alliance priest on the server smolderweb. I was the first level 60 in my guild, but not by much. But I was ""ahead of the curve"", and as such, most horde I met were friendly. I would often even mind control them, give them fort, and help them quest. 

I was good. Noble. Just.

With one caveat.

For some reason I cant help myself. Sometimes it makes me sad, others, I feel a sick sense of joy.

You see, If i am near both horde, and a high place...  *ploop*. Gone.

 On the boat to ratchet? *ploop*.

On the chains outside brd? *ploop*

Mind control is bound to my number 5 hotkey. Ahead of flash heal. Ahead of smite. It is almost instinctive at this point.

I am ending the lives of noble warriors and fellow wielders of the light, without honor, or mercy.

In a real fight I'm done, unable to even defend myself. Unless....

4677,I’m surprised I’m enjoying 60 so much,"Hey all,

This may sound weird but as much as I love Vanilla, I was very aware of my hatred for end game in Vanilla... at least on PServers.

So a lot of Vanilla end game is gold-inspired. I remember on my mage on a PServer I farmed DME Lashers for hours on end for an epic mount. Then for hours on end for Bloodvine. Then hours on end for enchants. Then hours on end for consumes. I learned to loathe it.

It got me thinking, why am I having a blast at 60? What’s different here?

For me it’s two things. 

1: PServers were so overtuned it’s insane. AV comes to mind as a horribly overtuned annoying mess. But UBRS is another good example.

2: I actually keep everything this time. This server won’t get shut down randomly. It won’t lose all of its population because another fresh realm opened leading to a dead Naxx patch. If I fish for 4 hours I have that forever.

So maybe my previous hatred for Vanilla end game wasn’t justified. Yes it has problems but I’m somehow having a blast when before I was expecting to hit 60 and maybe slog through.

I’m curious to see how others feel about Vanilla end game, whether it be someone who has done intense raiding on PServers and always comes back or just someone who hasn’t done it before.

Thanks everyone! If you need me I’ll be corpse run spamming until I get to the UBRS door!",1570497899.0,"I’m surprised I’m enjoying 60 so muchHey all,

I started WoW during 1.0 and have had an on/off relationship with it ever since.

Then Warlords hit and I believe I played for about 2-3 weeks then just sort of threw up my hands and said ""I think I'm done"".

4695,Mage vs warlock,"So, I'm still going back and forth. I leveled warlock more to get a better feel but honestly made the choice even harder. I definitely see mage as the good boy that everyone likes and wants. Locks are like the edgy boys that use dark magic and summon demons. I definitely like the dark side more, HOWEVER i don't like that souls take up 1 slot each when mage can stack there food and water and give it away like candy on Halloween to everyone while locks have to kill mobs and fill up there bag to help groups. It's like having a profession that doesn't take up a slot. Portals are great as well. Yes I know locks can summon people but I think portals will be coming in more handy. The DPS is amazing for both but locks are dots and mage is raw damage. I keep getting mixed answers on who can solo dung's better. Nice that locks have a pet next to them but mages have CC's and blows up everything close to it. The free mount is great at 40 and is honestly my favorite mount. I'm so half and half and it drives me mad. I know just to play what I enjoy more but it's honestly extremely split.

Mages: portals, big AOE, huge damage, food/water

Locks: pet, mount, dark magic, good damage

What would help me choose is knowing what is best to solo with. Which can I do dung runs and gold runs completely solo best on? Both are fun to play so it's really down to now which is the best solo class.

Please help me or please give me insight as to why you choose one over the other.

4699,"Incredibly Rare Dungeon BOEs, how to value?","Hello all. I am having trouble valuing an incredibly rare item I obtained while leveling. On retail the item Papal Fez (an Uldaman BoE) is extremely sought after and sells for over 1 million gold. This of course is due to its rarity, collectability and transmog.


How would we value this in Classic, the factors if transmog don't apply and I wouldn't assume anyone really cares about the collector's value. The point still stands that its incredibly rare and I assume its good for twinking in the 30-39 tier.


What are some thought on this item from reddit?

4701,Need help pricing this - Plans: Stronghold Gauntlets,"I opened a lockbox that dropped from a UBRS mob and was surprised to find some epic plans in them. I got Plans: Stronghold Gauntlets.

I am thinking I may be the first on my server/faction to get these plans as I haven't ever seen them up on the AH.

From what I understand these gloves are usually used for PvP and don't really see much use outside of that. They also appear rather costly to make. The materials alone would cost roughly 500g right now on my server.

Does anyone have any idea what I should ask for if I were to sell these plans?

Feel free to comment the things you love about it too - I'd be keen to read them!

- no pressure to play fast.

I don't have a lot of time to play so classic, although everything takes longer to get, makes me feel less anxious about racing to get to the end. 

- community is wonderful. I'm not sure if this is everyone's experience but I'm finding the community to be much nicer and more helpful than on retail. Non of my old friends play anymore so I'm hoping I'll find a new family on this new server.

- chance to practice my German. Since taking a break in Mists, I've moved to St Petersburg, Russia, so I made an EU account and chose to play on a German server. My German is a bit rusty but it's a good way to get the language skills back. 

- challenge is rewarding. I did a quest a few levels ago, killing a dude surrounded by tons of mobs. Died about ten times trying to isolate him and beat him down. I definitely wailed a few times irl but finishing that quest was a huge buff to my feels.

4721,Unpopular opinion about the classic community!,"I see many posts  on this subreddit every day on how helpful the community has been so far , and how social interaction has made wow a totally different game compared to the solo-friendly version of BFA . While i agree with this sentiment , and me myself had many positive acquaintances during my level up , i have also faced a totally different aspect of the community . Here are some of my experiences :

&#x200B;

1. We do stratholme with a group . Mask of the unforgiven drops , bis for rogue and warrior . Me(a rogue) and the warrior needs . I win and the warrior leave the group in middle of the dungeon .
2. Before i hit level 60 , i requested invites from many groups for LBRS-UBRS . Most people didn't accept me because i was level 58 or 59 . Sometimes i tried to persuade the group leader and it worked . So i ended up in a group where me , a lvl 58 rogue was first place in dps meters , wondering why i was rejected in the first place .
3. People leaving UBRS raid group at 1st wipe , because this group aint gonna make it fast . So you are saying , that leaving the group and trying to find another group for 30 mins is fast?
4. Tanks skipping half mobs in a dungeon because that is the optimal way .
5. Half group Advertisements i see in the LFG channel are about groups with reserved items ( so im gonna come in this dungeon WITH NO CHANCE of getting my bis? Fuck off .
6. A tank wanted to replace me in the group because we didn't ""gel"" . I was first in the dps meters at the time and the only guy in the group that constantly interrupted enemy heals . 
7. I could go on with the list but i think i have given some good examples so far , and now i will dress my conclusion .

**My conclusion:** I am aware that there are good and bad apples in every gaming community . Toxicity and bad behavior are part of the human nature after all . I am also aware that every player is totally FREE to play the game in what ever way he likes , whether it be with reserved items , or leave a group whenever he likes  or play solo  for optimal XP .However i do think that the classic community is over hyped . The game does a TERRIFIC job at bringing players together , and that's how i met most of my in-game friends so far but the majority of the community consists of people that look after only their personal benefit and only care about the community aspect , when it's also in line with their personal benefit . I may get down-voted because this is not another story of a lovely stranger who sent me an heart-warming letter .

4752,I am one with the Void,"My goal yesterday was to get 40 before the work week started.  8 hours on my couch and I finally completed the last of the quests I needed for the last bar to 40.  I was running out of the Bloodscalp troll area in STV and I found a little tiny 35 gnome warlock who clearly just rezzed. He turned, saw me, and immediate started running from me.  Now, I had no intentions of killing this poor bastard, as with many Alliance I spared before him, but thought it would be fun to chase him for a bit.  He eventually ""hid"" behind a pillar and I /wave'd goodbye as all I cared about was turning in my quests, getting 40, getting my mount, and getting Shadowform.

First stop was Nesingway's camp.  Strolled up to see a bunch of red bars with skulls sitting there with a bunch of skeletons surrounding the area. I sprinted to Nesingway, but a skull-level hunter become my target with Aimed Shot casting. Dead before I reached the tents. Ran back, rezzed, and spammed clicks to complete quest. I managed to get that 1400 XP but they got me again.

My corpse was in a position where I could spawn out of site. I got away safely, but the damage was done. My mind was weak after 8 hours of play. Though I haven't learned Shadowform yet, I could feel the void reaching in, tainting my thoughts. The 34 druid I saw on the way to turn in my last 3 quests never stood a chance. I saw he just killed some troll at 50% health. He never saw me.  He decided to pull another.  I unleashed my Pain and Plague and that's all it took.  I kept running as troll took advantage and finished him off. Luckily, I crossed no others on the way and reached camp to complete my quests and reach level 40. I returned to Undercity and allowed the Void to take control.  

One more quest to turn in before it was time to rest for the night.  My journey was to southern Arathi Highlands.  The void whispered again ""Remember what these Alliance did to you here? They took advantage of your weakness. Not allowing you to get your little Raptor hearts.""  I remembered. That poor warrior was dead before he could target me.  That mage, while trying to AOE down 3 mobs, become suddenly plagued before being feared into more mobs than he could handle.

I was near my destination, at the battered Thondal Span, were I came across a duo of level 32s on their way home to Khaz Modan. ""Finish them"" the void whispered.  My consciousness had a second wind and I was able to fight it. ""I will not murder innocent ones anymore"" I responded.  The Void whispered back ""They are the enemy, they are the ones who stand in your way of greatness. Ruin them, if not kill them, then make them suffer. Take control of their minds"" and my holy consciousness faded and the Void regained control again. I sent them running in fear as I reached out and took control of the priest, stopping him in his tracks. His paladin brother was running back to stun me, but he was too late. Under my control, I sent the priest off the ruined bridge into the waters below. His brother of the light tried his best to seek vengeance, but it was all for naught. I spread Pain into his mind and started to melt his poor, dwarven face. The holy dwarf knew he had protection, and the light granted him a shield. The shield did not last and his mind, like his friends, was mind.  Off the bridge he went, but he was not as lucky as the priest before him. He caught an edge and did not make it to the water.  

I looked on at this corpse, and with his friend no where in site. I did not feel sorrow or horror in what I have done, but joy. I felt the power. The strength the Void had granted me in this new form.  The power to spread pain, suffering, and plague to those I deem worthy of a swift death.  The others, the ones less fortunate, will lose their mind to my control and I will do with them as I please.

4767,Ultra casual Hunter Pre-Raid Anti-Dungeon BiS Guide (short),"Aight so uh, I'm a lazy bastard. Sorry to say it. I cannot be arsed grinding 15 dungeons a day to eternity for a drop of mine (though strangely enough I have no problems helping people when I need nothing), and frankly the list for pre-raid BiS was kinda appalling for a hunter playing casually at the moment (until phase 3 or so)...

&#x200B;

So I made myself a little pre-raid BiS shortlist that is ridiculously ""budget"" and encourages general money-making instead of spamming dungeons and hoping for the best. Only two items requires actual ""rng"" luck, that being the cloak and one of the rings (the ring is from Maraudon so you can begin early before hitting 60).

&#x200B;

Of course, as you probably know by now if you're still reading, this is all based on supply on the Auction House.

&#x200B;

Personally I could grind whelplings for days and not get tired of it, but I'd rather hang myself than do dungeons for 5 hours straight (raids not included).

&#x200B;

I guess what I'm trying to say is that this ""guide"" encourages you to do what you want, but doesn't force you to stick with grinding one specific dungeon (outside the cape and ring) to get ready. It also lets you grab many of the pieces early on for pennies, making you quite strong while you're grabbing the last few levels towards 60.

&#x200B;

So without further ado, here we go! (If you have any notes or constructive criticism on items that might be easier to get and better in each slot, feel free to let me know! THE CRITERIA IS THAT IT HAS TO BE GUARANTEED THROUGH MONETARY PAYMENT OR AS A QUEST REWARD DOABLE OUTSIDE RAIDS.)

HoJ is a hell to obtain, all melee dps are falling over themselves trying to farm it atm. As alliance lose out on 1% hit, I recommend getting it elsewhere - like the Warmonger 2h sword that gives 3% hit)

&#x200B;

Set bonuses:

&#x200B;

That's pretty much it. The enchants are probably self-explanatory, but let me know if you'd like to know.

&#x200B;

The build ends up on 6% hit, which you can supplement with either a biznicks scope on the xbow (+3% hit) or the +3% hit from the survival talent ""Surefooted"".

&#x200B;

EDIT: u/AVWoW suggested that you could also use Warmonger (Bind on Equip - Req. level 47) to supplement the +3% hit, saving some talent points and letting you grab the sniper scope instead. You DO lose out on up to 28 agility (a lot), but it's doable, and the sword is pretty cheap.

&#x200B;

Finally, some people expressed a bit of confusion at my list. The premise is not to COMPLETELY AVOID dungeon grinding, but to get as close to ""Pre-raid BiS"" as you can without being FORCED to run specific dungeons until you get the godsbedamned loot you need (don't forget you need it to drop, and you also need to win the roll.)

Unfortunately some items are just not easily replaced, and until later phases, there's no viable non-rng option to replace Blackstone Ring or Cape of the Black Baron outside rng drops in dungeons/raids. Blackstone Ring is a fortunate case as you can start early on Maraudon while leveling, or at 60 most, if not all classes can solo Princess Theradras in short, pretty fast runs. Since this is a hunter ""guide"", obviously I don't need to point out we can solo her. The cape has no alternative that comes even close, and the list aims to not cripple you, but keep you as close to pre-raid BiS as possible without forcing you to grind only specific content (where possible) for the loot you need, and to avoid having you compete with as many people as possible.

&#x200B;

I'll also point out that one of the strong points of this guide is that, while many people actually have funds for these significant improvements while leveling up, people usually wait to level 55-60, then start grinding for the BiS stuff due to people not wanting to take along lower level players for stuff like lbrs/ubrs/strat/scholo etc.

Most of the items on the list are rather cheap, and especially the crossbow is amazing. Equippable at level 51, Heartseeking Crossbow will last you all the way to level 60. It costs on average 10-15g on the auction house, which is an absolute steal. Granted, the pre-raid BiS crossbow is better for sure, but it comes from Stratholme which you're unlikely to do until around level 58-60.

I hit 60 recently and I would like to spec my mage so he is viable for both PvP and PvE... The link above is what I am thinking about doing and there are a few things I am not 100% about... for example I choose not to get imp counter spell in favor of going to deep frost. I guess I feel deep frost is better for PvE, having frostbite + shatter is good for PvP but also useful in PvE... whereas imp counter spell is really only good for PvP.

I hit 60 recently and I would like to spec my mage so he is viable for both PvP and PvE... The link above is what I am thinking about doing and there are a few things I am not 100% about... for example I choose not to get imp counter spell in favor of going to deep frost. I guess I feel deep frost is better for PvE, having frostbite + shatter is good for PvP but also useful in PvE... whereas imp counter spell is really only good for PvP.

Every guide I have read suggests the devilsaur set as best in slot so I'm tempted to make it myself but it is also the most common spec and has high competition for materials.

I was considering making the black Dragon scale 3 set for myself and buying the devilsaur 2 set and wearing both but none of the guides suggest the dragonscale as a Bis so am I wasting my time? 

Is elemental even considered for a hunter? Has good agi and Crit stuff but it seems mostly intended for Druids and shaman healers. 

In this thread I would like to compile all forms of information about leatherworking and other BIS items for hunters, preferably from people who have played hunters and have had this same dilemma. Any other info would be great as well!

Is there a “general method” one can follow to engage in PvP combat as a Druid? I’ve lost a ton of PvP combat, not counting the ones that were obvious ganks, and I seem to struggle the most against hunters and shamans. (Based on what I’ve encountered so far... I don’t fight other druids, and I haven’t engaged in many “fair” fights with other classes yet.)

The PvP guide I was following loosely suggested opening a PvP combat with cat form to get a bleed off, switch, cast heal, switch to bear form to tank damage - but by the time I get to bear form I usually have next to no health and my HoTS can’t keep up with the damage and unless I panic drink a healing potion, I’m dead.

So I want to get better, obviously, because I’m losing 1v1s against people my own level and it kind of sucks - I have won a few, but nowhere near enough. I realize this is a dumb question and a YMMV situation but...... I’m in STV now and suffering so pls help

4840,I´m sorry little one... I shouldn´t have done that,"Questing in arathi highlands in a cave .. got attacked by a 2 lvl lower hunter and a lock which was 3 lvl lower. I normally don´t really get angry or anything but I passed by them just wanting to do some questing and they started attacking me. So I died in a 100 to 0 perma fear and wandered back to my cave. I actually intended to just continue farming cause the cave was big and what ever but they would constantly look for me and just kill be before I could down a mob. After the 2nd time I just had enough. I went into the cave and basically murdered the lock while berserker rage was active. I knew it was a pvp starter cause he just stood there spamming fear over and over while my rage was going on. After it run out I kicked fear once and finished him off, turning around and continued to murder the hunter who apparently had equally less clue from pvp. After that I just waited in the cave for them murdering them over and over always starting with the lock. If I could find them with low health and engaged even better. After a while I continued to murder the pet as well. It was about 2 hours where no one had done any quest progress.

No, im not coward or asshole. I start combat with another mob and then this rogue amushes me from stealth and kills me.

Well now multiply this story 5times becouse in last 24 hr i got killed EVERY time i encoutered an enemy rogue player. Everytime, i was the one who saw them first, fighting, i could easily kill each one of them but like i said, i dont see any enjoyment in killig a fighting oponent.

Now to my question ... how do i fight them?

Im 100% dead meat when they start from stealth, there is simply nothing i know i can do. Im trying to wingclip them but they usualy pop Evas so there is close to 0 chance to do that but even if i manage to wingclip them, i have cripling poison on me so im also slowed and still cant get as far as needed to do something to them.

Another scenario ... i knew rogue in stelath is somewhere around me ... so i put down a flare, i detected him, makred him but he was already too close and i died.

Should i just kill every rogue on sight just in case (and so far ... 100% of rogues i met was trying to kill me and most succeded) or just mark them ..,. just in case, but they will vanish and im as good as dead already.

Should i just kill every rogue on sight just in case (and so far ... 100% of rogues i met was trying to kill me and most succeded) or just mark them ..,. just in case, but they will vanish and im as good as dead already.

Is there any working macro for FD and freez trap?

Thanks! :)",0

My two picks so far are Druid and Priest and I’m looking for some input on both classes as I’m torn between the two. 

Druid: I love this classes ability to be split between the 3 roles but i’ve been told they are a jack of all trades master of none type class. Is this true? I would love to give tanking a go but not sure how effective bear tanks are? I haven’t grouped with a single one so far. I also like this classes healing abilities but the lack of a res seems like it could be a pain! 

Priest: This class holds a certain place in my heart as the only bit of vanilla I ever played was on a Troll Priest. They are obviously strong healers and this would be good for me. But I would only be able to heal as I understand it guilds won’t take Shadow priests as DPS? This class is really overplayed aswell which takes abit of the experience away for me. But I realise this is for a reason and they are very strong. How is the l leveling process for Priests. Is it smooth?  I know I wrecked a good few priests on my way up till around 45-50 and then they picked up.

this weekend i (finally) hit 60. My Phase 1 endgame will be running Dungeons and collecting a full suit of blue BiS. Maybe pug Ony sometime, but active raiding is not an option currently. So when Phase 2 hits i really want to do PvP. World PvP skirmishes where i can leave at any time and have no fixed dates in the calendar fit my end-of-work-schedule better than raiding.

Now the problem. I'm quite shit at PvP. Always have been. Spent a lot of time in AV, back in the day. 90% of it dead at the GY. And all current PvP experiences can be boiled down to being fisted by 2+ players while having Questmobs on me. Not that i ever expected a fair fight from Horde scum /spit/spit/spit/spit anyway, but a bit of 1v1 practice would have been helpful for a PvP noob.

So: How should i prepare for W-PvP / Phase 2? Duel in front of IF all day and that's it? How do i learn? Get all 1000+ gadgets and trinkets and win ez?

There is a serious lack of strategy info for the Princess Theradras boss. All the youtube content is about how certain classes can solo her.

My main problem is that she seems to reset the threat table at certain intervals. She is also immune to taunts.

I was wondering if any tanks out there have some good tips to help my healers not die during this boss fight. It is very hard most of the time to instruct your party of randoms to stop all damage and healing at coordinated intervals.

I assume the main problem is that we cannot continue to build threat while she is doing the knockback skill which lasts a good 5 seconds. Is it viable to pull her all the way over to a wall in the beginning? Can we continue to attack and build threat during her knockback ability in this case?

4930,Too many healers? Should I re-roll tank?,"My questions is: why there are so many healers and absolutely zero tanks on the realms?

I started off leveling a rogue when classic came out because thats the only class I have never ever played before, and I was very curious how it will go. A subtlety spec, I can dps in dungeons and also one-shot ambush enemies. Or not then run away and try again next time. I have never played vanilla before for more than a few levels, I started playing in the BC and since then I am kinda addicted to wow, and mainly to healing. I was quick to discover that rogue is really not my cup of tea, as WPvP was either I one shot ambush the enemy or I keep chasing them while they dot/pet-kill me. And getting into dungeons was hard as well. I wanted to heal again. To be good at what I was good for 10+ years.

So I re-rolled a priest. As for leveling its quite a nice experience to binge-watch netflix while I wand every single mob down to 0% and I developed some kind of wand-ddiction, looking and collecting for my next ""ability"" every time. WPvP is something I did not experienced so far other than buffing the enemy while MC'ing them (and getting killed after) or simply just trying to outheal their damage while I hope someone comes to my aid. However the bigger problem is that not even healing dungeons are fun. Why? Simply because I can't. Sure its easy to keep renew up on tank and wand the mob when you actually get into a dungeon but the main reason I can not heal is because there is no tank to heal. I keep seeing LFG chat and City chat that 75% of the people are looking a tank, and 20% are looking for a DPS but only around 5% for an actual healer. I keep seeing ""Priest healer (or dps) looking for dungeon"" like they are begging to take them even if its out of their leauge or they are way too high level for a dungeon.

So in a desperate times I call for the o-mighty reddit... do you guys experience similar things as I do? Is this common on all realms or maybe just the one I'm playing on? And finally... would it be worth to re-roll to a warrior and then maybe get into doing dungeons ?

4933,Where can I read more about how weapon skill and hit rating works in classic?,"A few days ago I didn't really understand why Edgemasters was good, but then somebody explained to me about how weapon skill reduces the damage reduction from glancing blows, therefore +7 weapon skill has a huge increase to your overall damage making it better than any other gloves. I was also made aware that having a higher weapon skill reduces your chance to miss, so you don't need to take as much hit rating gear.

I tried to do some more reading about this so that I can understand the exact numbers but from about 30 minutes of googling i couldn't find a comprehensive explanation and i retrieved a lot of conflicting information. 

I would like to be able to understand to what extent weapon skill has an effect on glancing blows damage reduction and also hit chance. For example, one post i read said that a fury warrior needs 9% hit for raiding, but if it is an orc warrior using axes it only needs 8% because of the weapon skill passive. But then another post said that an orc only needs 6%, conflicting information. And then as for the glancing blows, do they still need edgemasters if they have the passive weapon skill? If anyone knows of somewhere I can read factual definitive comprehensive information about this I would be very happy! Thank you

Assuming you are fighting a raid boss (level 63, defence skill 315) then the following is true:

Glancing blows always have a 40% chance to occur on white hits, this cannot be changed.

Without any bonus weapon skill (300), the damage penalty on glancing blows is 35%

With edgemasters and no racial (307), you lower your damage penalty on glancing blows to 7% 

With edgemasters and no racial (307), your hit cap is lowered to 5.8%

With edgemasters AND orc/human racial weapon skill (312), you lower your damage penalty on glancing blows to 5%

4972,BOE drops in groups. Need when need or always greed?,"Hei, this question comes from not really being certain what I think is correct.

Context: a group is doing an instance and a very nice BOE item drops which on of the group members need. The other members are saving for mount or some other things, and could indirectly benefit from selling it.

In vanilla there was no question. Need is need for use now, while classic it seems like valuable BOE drops should be greeded by everyone. If a random world drop worth 300g drops I can understand the lines gets a bit blurry.

Should it be allowed to need on item even if it is BOE? Like if the pattern for robe of archmage drops and there is a mage with 300 tailoring in the group, should he get it?

I would prefer the answers to be a yes or no, and then an explanation in which cases it might not be true or an explanation underlying your opinion. Would also like to know if you play in Europe/US/Asia, as it would be interesting to know if there was a difference.

PS: in the case above let's ignore the people who lie, as this is wrong. The case is for people who actually need it and will use it.

Edit: this post would be more interesting if people would also add which some they play in. America, Asia or Europe. Because the conflict is only there when the systems are different.

talk to peeps

it gets better at 60 with a bit of gear

healers are precious and need to be protected

network

it has its ups and downs, its up to you how you handle it

KNOWLEDGE, seriously please know where you are going, or at least ask/tell someone with experience to help

dont get cocky kid

TL/DR

So to preface, im not some 3000IQ god that can predict tick perfect time to use abilities or map placements 20 moves in advance, just a regular dps who wanted to contribute since my guild had a bad deficit in tanks willing to get people through mid and late content, im going to outline some useful stuff i learned to hopefully help others who are tank curious, and since im waiting on some attainment shenanigans with a pug i might as well jot some thoughts down, spelling issues abound, goodbye grammar, here we go...

communication is the single most overpowered ability in our toolkit, i was super worried about talking to people and telling the group where to go and you know where that got me? doing a bunch more death runs than i needed, dps too overzealous; ask(politely even, if they are being dicks about it because it seems to help) for them to give you a few seconds before busting out every aoe ability under the sun, some dude fucking about, whisper him to see whats going on, need a quest/loot/wanna try a new thing make sure you communicate with your group, it has increased the quality of life dramatically and made tanking overall a pleasant experience, oh and if your pug is doing something well, give them a complement, good morale really goes a long way not only in making the run better and covering up for mistakes on your end and on theirs but it opens up more opportunities

at 60 it get a whole lot easier, i had a perception i was garbage because an under geared sub 40 war was  having a shit time handling threat, it was demoralizing to the point where i was avoiding getting to 60 knowing i was going to have to tank runs for my guild, while we wont be aoe gods without some gimmicks, we can do just fine, by using a few tools like telling the dps to give you a second, thunder clapping and tab sunder/revenge(the stun skill is nice utility in dungeons) just keep cycling targets, i recommend getting a threat meter, this allows you to better see whos creepin up on you so you can give that particular target a little extra love, another thing is to not over threat a target, like the one both mages are deleting from existence thats 1/4 of an hp bar left and slowly crawling to them at a massive distance? yah i think thy are going to be juuust fine without you popping taunt and all your rage for it to just drop, make sure to plan to use your resources, it keeps peeps alive, learn your utility, there is some good stuff buried there that your healers will love you for using/knowing

speaking of happy healers, happy healer happy life, or something of the sort, dps can face tank a mob for a little bit, but a healer getting melted spazing to heal themselves meaning you arent getting heals, things go surprisingly crazy when a healer needs to break their flow, they are the best and need to be protected at all cost, communicate with them as much as you can, i always try to take it nice and slow at the start just to see the personality of the healer, some blow their mana some play it super cautiously, neither is wrong but the quicker you identify what type of person is keeping you alive the better you will be at planning encounters to help make sure a run finishes, a slow and steady run is cheaper and on average faster than a run that you are either eating/dying constantly where people are stressed out , at least in my opinion

pugs, they are going to break you sometimes, but remember everyone makes mistakes, its better to forgive and try to help than to blow up on the pug who is fucking up, stuff like that can break a fragile group, and its going to take a whole lot longer to get people replaced/getting a whole new dungeon run together than figuring out the weakspot and helping to the best of your ability, still if the goodwill isnt there and you made your best effort no shame in calling it/replacing the problem area, ive had a balance of both good and soul crushing awful experiences, you get to decide how its going to affect the group make the most of it

the last and most important thing is dont get cocky and dont be afraid to say no, i had both issues after getting comfortable and then i saw what a real tank could do and i was humbled but made considerably more interested in bettering myself, its easy to feel like a big fish because you are needed, lend a hand where you can, but dont sacrifice your own happiness in the process, in the long run if its going to burn you out then the overall good is going to be diminished, once i started limiting myself to a couple of guild friendly/support runs where i dont really benefit but my guild/or random stranger does it increased my quality of life and made me want to do more raids not just to get comfortable with my new skill set but because of the positive effect is has overall, getting a sweet loot drop that you have been hounding feels amazing, but nothing can replace the feeling of someone thrilled they finished up a long goal, or being recognized for your ability to be a ""dependable""/""good"" tank in a whisper after a long dungeon even if everything doesn't go the way you wanted

I thought that this would be an easy task, set up a WeakAura for the debuff duration and the stacks in order to track it easily . I intended to stack up to 5 and heal via mouse over while the boss is always in target and I don’t lose track of the stacks. While testing this setup solo on random mobs and in 5man dungeon, I didn’t notice any issues. Though yesterday during raid and immediate with the first trash group, the WeakAura bugged heavily: timer went to zero, stacks dropped, I was totally blind  and I could only assume wether the timer is fine or I fucked up entirely. Even the stack counter from my LunaUnitFrames and kui nameplates went down and bugged for the weaving stacks. I assume that the interference might be due to the other debuff slots but I’m not sure though.

I've seen so much god damn drama over this that it's ridiculous, and I am seriously considering adverting my UBRS runs as explicitly not fucking with Jed.  If he's there, he's there, if not, too bad.

I am sick of groups falling apart while we wait for people to find Jed.   I am sick of people arguing and name calling over who gets it.   I am tired of waiting forever for people to look for him.   I am sick of people leaving midrun, mostly mages, because they got or didn't get the trinket.

And before you say anything, I am leading the group and doing a full UBRS in 45 mins with a semi competent group, so it's not a slog or anything. These people are just assholes. They're there for the trinket, and dont give a fuck about anyone else.

We probably spent more time trying to find Jed, and reorganize the raid, than it took to get to him, and they still just bail.

Fuck Jed!  I am done.  You mages can go sit and spin.",1570456715.0,"Fuck JED! There, I said it! Fuck Jed! I am not helping people exploit to find him anymore.I am so sick of the drama over this stupid boss, and that dumbass trinket.

I've seen so much god damn drama over this that it's ridiculous, and I am seriously considering adverting my UBRS runs as explicitly not fucking with Jed.  If he's there, he's there, if not, too bad.

I am sick of groups falling apart while we wait for people to find Jed.   I am sick of people arguing and name calling over who gets it.   I am tired of waiting forever for people to look for him.   I am sick of people leaving midrun, mostly mages, because they got or didn't get the trinket.

4999,What to do with a Staff of Jordan,"Hey guys, 

A couple days ago I ended up looting a Staff of Jordan on a Gorilla in STV (yup, lucky me!). I had a quick look on the AH but it turns out it doesn't really sell (or at least not for much), so my question would be : is it going to gain in value in the next few months or should I just settle for less and sell it now ? 

Have a great day !",1570456361.0,"What to do with a Staff of JordanHey guys,
