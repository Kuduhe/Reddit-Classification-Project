2,Two insane rare drops; Fairbanks.,"I was questing with my dear friend in SV late last night (to avoid the ridiculous PvP. While we were killing Buccaneers on FFA loot; Bow of Searing Arrows and Parrot Cage: Hyacinth Macaw dropped on back to back mobs..

Seems as if the BoSA is a twink item and it might not reach value until phase 3. Not too sure how popular PvP is for twinks in the 30s. Haven’t seen any of this item on my server yet. 

The Macaw however I guess is just an item I can toss up semi frequently below AH price around 250g (???) on my server. 

This is my first character in over 10 years and I have about 10 gold at the moment. Thankfully I’m a warlock so my mount is inexpensive. My friend and I have decided to split whatever profit we make off these items. (FFA loot)


What do you guys think I should do?

10,Why is my friend getting more xp per mob? Do higher levels just get more xp off of the same mobs? He's 38 and I'm 37.,"So me and my friend have been levelling together all the way. We got to 35 and he did some warrior q's and a couple in thousand needles recently and he's now just over a level ahead of me.

We were questing last night and ended up taking about xp per kill, at which point realising that he was getting about 133xp to my 128xp per mob.

The things that are NOT causing this are:

Double xp: we didn't have double xp

Damage: we tried one of us doing most of the damage then switched and he got more xp both times

Proximity: we were both right next to the mobs

Level: mobs were yellow for both of us

So the only thing we could think is that higher levels get more xp per mob... but why would that be the case? That just means as soon as one player gets a bit farther ahead, that the gap will keep getting bigger. 

Any knowledge on what's going on and if my only option is to level without him is appreciated.

12,Toxic Guild or am I over thinking?,"So just a little back story about myself. I started playing WoW during BC, hit 70 the day before Wrath released, during my time in wrath I had 2 level 80’s both of which were in a pretty good guild that I have fond memories of and cleared ICC 10/25N and progression 10H (made it to Professor Putricide before I quit). Fast forward to legion where I started playing again. Only had time for 1 character so I mained a Restro druid which I have all the AoTC’s and raided mythic content (killed Guldan on mythic, didn’t raid ToS much because of all the time I spent in NH). 

I’d like to say I’m pretty knowledgeable about the game and what I need to do if I’m not a GL or RL. I always bring pots to raids. Feed guild mates herbs at no charge. I try to help my guild mates as much as I can if I’m not currently engaged in a dungeon.

Fast forward. Hit 60 as a warlock with 13 days played since launch, while working 40 hours a week. Joined a guild the day I hit 60, just out of the blue I get a whisper while I’m in IF. Still doing the same things I normally do. Bringing pots, feeding herbs, and helping whenever I’m available. We have downed rag twice and ony 3 times (made it to domo once before but didn’t have enough douses). On the second raid things started to get heated between a lot of people who clearly weren’t in this clique that is obvious between all the council members. Out of all the herbs I’ve sent to GL (making nothing in return) I asked for a fire pot last night (I used 3 during the whole raid) and he told me 2g.....lol. I’ve prolly sent the guilds bank alt at minimum 3 stacks of dream foil, silversage, and icecap. I’ve been there for about 12-14 caster drops, all of which have gone to the council warlock’s or the council mages. The sword or dagger that drops off I garr, I forget the name, no one even got to roll. GL just insta looted it to himself. I got an optional BiS last night only because the other casters said it’s not BEST in slot. I asked for help with the warlock mount Scholo quest after the raid was over, only responses I got was from 3 of the 10 people who also have the same feelings towards the guild as I do,  which is awesome those guys are cool af. There’s a lot of dick sucking from the council members towards the original founders of the guild and that’s obvious. The micromanagement has come to a point of if a RL trades you and you don’t have any fire pots and mana pots, instant raid kick. The micromanagement of the healers is insane, it’s to where the RL is telling who to res who and who can drink or who can’t during trash pulls. All while this is happening one of the GMs forgets a douse at Mag lol. But hey at least the healers know who to res. I’m torn because all of the better guilds on the server are full on locks and we are killing shit but if I’m not getting anything for the effort I’m putting in what’s the point? Also I don’t feel like anything in classic is overly hard as long as you pay attention and have dbm it’s too easy. It’s to the point I want to quit and start back playing next year. I know this is long but I had to give context before I asked for advice. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.

19,Maybe Raiding Isn't For Me?,"TLDR: Did first raid, didn't enjoy myself like I thought I would, not sure why and wondering if anyone else has similar experiences. 

Just hit 60 on Monday and did MC last night for the first time. I had a lot of pre-raid BiS and was decently geared for a resto shaman. 

Never played resto shaman before but its easy enough.

Raid starts and guild drama starts right from the get go. Multiple people /gquit over not getting raiding spots. But raid goes on anyway.

We one shot every boss.

I got a slight upgrade piece of gear, nothing major, I also kept up with the other healers and pulled my weight.

But as we finished up, killed rag, had drama over the rag loot, I realized I had almost zero fun during the run.

I was SO excited to be doing MC again after all these years, I raced to 60 to get to experience raiding MC again like my 14 year old self did back in 2005. Yet, here I am at working the next day thinking ""man, am I just not cut out for raiding anymore?"".

I dont know why I feel like this, maybe I don't enjoy resto shaman, maybe I'm too old to deal with guild drama, maybe I expected it to be like modern WoW and near guarantee an upgrade, I don't know.

31,Affliction Warlock method of farming DM N is significantly more difficult if even viable at all,"With DM out yesterday I gave this method of farming the first boss in DM N a try. Video from what I assume is a private server: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up03rGFB-SY

I used to do this all the time on private servers. In classic this method of farming DM N appears to be much more difficult. The biggest issue is the mobs all seem to run at different speeds when they get on the ledge. They appear to glitch slightly and slow down which makes them get really spread out. You can’t keep them in a nice clump. The second issue is standing on the ramp causes everything to evade, if you stay on that ramp for more than a few seconds the mobs will get large health regeneration. The third less pressing issue is there is a random pat that moves down through the courtyard that didn’t exist when I did this on private servers.

I only ever did this method of farming on private servers, so I can’t say for certain if this was the way it was in classic. I’m annoyed by this though, this was a decent way to make money as affliction warlock.",1571258912.0,"Affliction Warlock method of farming DM N is significantly more difficult if even viable at allWith DM out yesterday I gave this method of farming the first boss in DM N a try.

37,Warlock Epic Mount,"Hello,

Was hoping some of my fellow Warlocks out there could provide some insight on a question I had regarding the epic mount quest chain.

The quest chain has you collect 30 Raging Beasts Blood.
Which is then followed by a quest to buy the Xorothian Dust for 140g from Banehollow. Then you must acquire 
6 Large Brilliant Shards, 25 Dark Iron Ore, 35 Black Dragonscales, and 10 Elixir of Shadow Power in order to create the bell, the wheel, and the Candle. Once you have completed this, then you can buy the Jeeves Jar, Black Lodestone, and Xorothian Glyphs for a total of 250g.

Here is my question: What point in this chain can you enlist the help of another warlock? Can you find someone who already has the bell, wheel, and candle and skip having to buy these expensive materials as well? Im already aware you can find someone with the Jar, glyphs, and lodestone and save 250g. Was curious how much of the chain you can skip if you have a warlock friend whos completed it.",1571258120.0,"Warlock Epic MountHello,

68,"So, lashers are immune to nature damage. Let's talk druid gold farming.","After a few hours of me and a few fellow guildies I have the following data about lasher farming:

1) mages can make 25-30g/hr from vendoring trash, plus whatever herbs or items they get.

2) priests can get about 10% less

3) druids are screwed, hurricane and thorns don't work.
 I tried Bear farming and could only do the smaller packs upstairs (stealthing to them) in about 2,5 minutes each; cat is out of question completely.
Balance farming doesn't work because you can't put Moonfire on whole packs before they shred you to pieces. I'm currently at 200 sp, 3k HP and 5,9k mana so I don't think it's gear related.

I'm also having trouble with Gob+Princess runs as my results are never consistent and if I get a kill on her, the whole run takes 18 minutes without reset timer. Compared to for example priests it feels like too much effort for relatively low reward.

As Alliance on a horde heavy server, aby outdoor farming spot is basically a 1v5 pvp match, which makes gold per hour tragic.

So far I have had some success with BRD Coffer runs with about 20-25g/hr but they keys need to be on AH for >35s, which seems to not be the case on Shazzrah anymore.

My last one is RFD enchanting runs where I get 3-4 shards per run and 60s-1g in vendor trash. Each run takes about 13 - 14 minutes. With current prices I can make 34-46g/hr, which is already a drop of 15% over the last two weeks. I'm completely dependent on the market and can never unload more than 8 shards at once or someone undercuts me and I need to cancel my auctions and undercut them.

Or even better is there a WoW option to basically have your mouse always locked until you use a button. Like in other MMORPG you would press ALT and can move your mouse, if you press ALT again it locks your camera and you don´t have to hold right mouse button all the time.

&nbsp;

Also, OF COURSE I'm going to assume you want the healer enemies dead first, why wouldn't I assume that? Should the enemies that rage and destroy tanks when they DO rage go down first? Then mark them! I'm not saying lay down a polymorph mark, or a secondary target mark, but at least put down a skull so I know which one you want dead first so I don't end up pulling agro. I have nameplates turned on because now I just focus on the target with the least health *because you couldn't be bothered to mark the damn target*. Also mark them from the beginning, not ten seconds after the battle has already begun. And if we have a mage who's using sheep, mark who you want sheeped, rather than let me continue striking and accidentally hitting the sheep.

&nbsp;

You want patience? Be patient yourself! The healer is at half health because you failed to hold agro, and now he's at half mana too because he's trying to heal everyone after EVERYONE had to start tanking because you lost agro! Aggro that was lost because you didn't mark who you wanted to take down first!

&nbsp;

Also we're ALL (yourself included!) about 1-2 levels below the mobs in the area, some more than that, pull the damn mob behind a corner! Pull him far back! His buddies are a spitting distance away, them and the pat no one saw coming! And then of course the mob runs and you ignore him, not even hamstringing him when he got to low health because you wanted to focus on the next target, and that mob then comes back with friends! Did you forget the part about all of us being 1-2 levels beneath the mobs in the area? We can't chase him or we bring the whole instance down on us! Pull the enemy back, don't fight them just a few feet away from their buddies! Heck, I'm a few levels below YOU, and I'm a rogue and I HAVE to fight in melee distance, OF COURSE my agro range is higher!

&nbsp;

Also the boss is red leveled to MOST of us (except you, he's only orange to you), at least wait to make sure we've all buffed so we're at the height of what we're capable of. We're already at the boss, what's your hurry?

128,Questions about DW Fury tanking.,"I don't want to prot tank. I want to be a cool kid!

In my view tanking was always about damage mitigation and the prot spec was the way to go! But it seems I was wrong and there's a whole world of possibilities out there for me.

It seems like tanking is more about threat generation to hold aggro. Warriors need rage for their abilities and rage is generated by doing and receiving damage. It seems the prot tree has 2 talent for threat generation: shield slam and defiance. 

The damage mitigation comes from the gear and spec doesn't seem to matter much, maybe toughness does help with that. 

On to the DW Fury tanking spec. The biggest thing about this is that you miss a lot of attacks and that + hit% gear is king to make sure you hit your attacks which generate rage you can use on abilities to generate threat. 

I would probably use a the following spec: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/-05050105305010051-5023011053

Is it possible to run this build with low gear and still tank end-game dungeons (ubrs?) or will the healer go crazy because I'll be taking a lot of damage? Or is it better to stick to ARMS + shield spec for now and grind some better gear to make the DW fury build work?

139,"Hunter Pet Happiness, Food, Dismissing, and AFKing in cities","I'm looking for a clear answer on this. Over the web and in-game I've heard so many conflicting stories and just want to know whats up.

&#x200B;

So I'm a BIS/T1/DM fully geared hunter and I really, really dislike having to feed my pet all the time-- I'm a hunter though so this is what I signed up for. No serious issues with that. Here's what I want clarification on: I often AFK in cities, but when I do so I have my pet around which causes him to gradually lose happiness. obviously I want to be able to stay logged into my main but I'd rather just be on my bank alt looking for groups so I don't lose precious gold for pet food (even if its only slight) 

The last thing I want is for him to run away and me having to tame another pet.

Firstly, if he stays dismissed does he lose happiness while in that state? What can I do to stay online as my hunter but not feel obligated to just be on another alt so I don't have a net decrease in wealth simply due to my pets food needs. Pet food is MAD expensive which brings to my next point: pet food is supposed to be better the closer it is to my pets level, but from my experience this makes NO SENSE

&#x200B;

Sometimes I'll feed him a level 35 cured ham steak from the IF vendor and he'll zoom right up to happy from unhappy. Sometimes the same thing but with a 45 quail and instead of happy he goes from unhappy to content. ALSO sometimes no matter what level of food, it does nothing. The feed pet effect is cancelled for no reason at times? The feed pet aura just goes away after a matter of seconds but sometimes it stays for like 20 seconds, all with varying outcomes with as a whole, leave me absolutely confused.

&#x200B;

What can I do to solve this? Is there something I don't know? I'm the hunter officer in my really solid PVE guild so I really can't not know these things-- the hard part is finding out the truth from all this conflicting garbage throughout every wow site ever. I need to get to the bottom of this, nothing makes sense, please enlighten me.

145,Countdown macro possible?,"Hello! 

I’m a level 41 bear/ cat druid. Have only tanked dungeons up to SM cath so far. Really enjoying it! I’ve had good runs and not so good runs.

When I feel it to be needed I kindly ask dpsers to let me build threat for a few secs before they start attacking. Sometimes people listen sometimes they dont. 

This got me thinking, is it possible to create some sort of countdown macro?

Maybe would be usefull if you are having trouble with people attacking mobs to soon.

Example: Imagine that you pull, click your macro and then in /s you get 5 sec countdown. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 - start attack. Much like i’ve seen a few rogues in retail while they are shrouding. I would top like chat bubbles above my character to do the countdown.

After watching Venruki's demonstration of the grind:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx8TWTEfaZM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx8TWTEfaZM)  I attempted to learn the grind and pull myself. I successfully managed to make the pull many times, but each time I am running into various problems.  


Problem 1: After Ice blocking and Frost Novaing and creating sufficient distance the mobs are being split apart by blizzard randomly breaking Frost Nova on some targets but not others.  I see some mages use Rank 1 Blizzard here but I do not know or understand why (Venruki did this in the video, and I am unsure about its purpose in the pull).  


Problem 2: Despite succeeding the pull and avoiding the aforementioned problem, I simply am running out of mana. I have around 6k Mana yet cannot strike the finishing blow (even with the use of the Mana Ruby).

179,"I'm unsure what to do , after all of my friends quit playing.","I'm sure many of you are in a similar situation, where you had to learn the lesson that you shouldn't base your choices to much on anyone else but yourself and are now stuck with the consequences. 

For me that lesson came in the form of realm and faction choice. 
I know reddit doesnt like it when people call realms ""dead"" cause they are probably still more populated then they were back in vanilla . 

So lets just say I find myself on a realm I don't personally like, playing on a faction I like a little bit less then the other one , playing pretty much alone right now, cause most of people I planned to play with have quit. 

I had(actually still have)big plans for WoW, I wanted to try to get Rank 14 (if I CAN actually get it I was never really sure of, so I wanted to see how far I could go), I wanted to gather all my class sets and maybe have a go at Thunderfury some day (some far far away day). 

But now I find myself unsure if I want to continue, since most of these goals ( or dreams rather) included playing with friends, at least from time to time.
It also included playing on a realm thats (in order to avoid saying ""dead"") maybe abit more competetive or has abit faster progress / aktive user base. 

Anyone got any advice ? Rerolling would be fairly painfull considering I'd have pretty much wasted leveling 2 characters to 60 and would be fairly far behind others by now (which would make finding a raidspot in a decent guild even more difficult).
But staying where I am now feels like its going to sap the fun from me long term.

Now I'm quite rarely welcomed to join as dps in 5 man groups  although I have MC raidspot as dps/offtank. People don't generally whisper back my requests to join or groups are almost always full and at the same time they just keep asking dps in the LFG-channel. I'm wearing near pre-raid bis feral dps gear and was lucky to get ""Wristguards of stability"" from MC raid.

Today when I asked to join as dps in - Dire Maul east(!) - I was questioned about my dps... lvl 55-60 dungeon. Classic really starts to feel like a fucking vanilla wow again. How many dps gets questioned about their dps before joining 5man groups? I want to know. How many tanks get questioned about threat per seconds? Do healers get questioned about their healing output?

My tanking has always been welcomed like *""Come here sir we have a table ready for you.""* but as dps? *""Oh no. I don't want to wipe because of you.""*

Hey All,

I am trying to create a Renew macro that does the following:

Non Modified: Casts downranked renew on mouseover. If no mouseover, casts downranked renew on target. If no target, casts downranked renew on self.

Shift-Modified: Does the exact same as above but with full rank renew. Here is what I think it should look like:

\#showtooltip

/cast\[mod:shift\]\[@mouseover,help,nodead\]\[help,nodead\]\[@player\]Renew;

/cast\[nomod\]\[@mouseover,help,nodead\]\[help,nodead\]\[@player\]Renew(rank 7)

I have run into a host of issues, usually determined by what I place in the third set of brackets. Is this macro possible? If so, what am I missing. Any help is appreciated. Thank you!",1571223286.0,"Renew Downrank Macro Help

They sit in Discord with Alliance guilds (including at least <Olympus>), and whenever other Horde members try to farm devilsaur leather, or even as so much get NEAR devilsaurs, they relay the farmers' positions to the Alliance guilds, who promptly arrive, kill them, camp them, and set up camp at the spirit healer.  The Alliance and Horde colluders have a truce to not-kill members of their guilds, but kill everyone else.

This is illegal, dishonorable, and immoral.

The ""mafia"" guilds then establish a monopoly on devilsaur leather/gear, and price gouge the items to about 3x their normal prices.

**Their operations are vast and organized** (e.g., 24/7 ""guarding"" of Un'Goro) **that the entire server has become aware of their operations.**  <clc> and <DOGZ> members often sell their gear with level-1 alts in attempt to remove themselves from their guilty guild tags (although some of the level 1 alts still use the guild tags).  https://imgur.com/a/OkQYBpB

Other <clc>/<DOGZ> members will leave their guild temporarily while selling it (to obfuscate their true guild affiliations).

238,Why do so many WoW guilds use rolling or loot council instead of DKP?,"In every other MMO I’ve played since Everquest, we have almost always used DKP. Usually the system is something like an open bid system, with DKP above a certain amount decaying to dissuade players from hoarding too much. This has always seemed like the fairest system because time invested is loot rewarded, and if you want something specific you can save for it. You always know where you stand and everyone gets loot. 

WoW is the one game where guilds almost seem to default to a rolling system, maybe with certain restrictions like one piece of loot per raid or other lockouts. But even with the most complicated rolling system, it is far from fair. Someone always gets screwed by RNG and someone gets way too lucky who doesn’t show up to raids. 

My question is... why? Most of the guilds on my server have insanely convoluted rolling systems that just seem so unnecessary when DKP exists. It’s kept me baffled, so perhaps someone has a better explanation than I’ve been able to think of myself.",1571217927.0,"Why do so many WoW guilds use rolling or loot council instead of DKP?In every other MMO I’ve played since Everquest, we have almost always used DKP.

But even with the most complicated rolling system, it is far from fair. Someone always gets screwed by RNG and someone gets way too lucky who doesn’t show up to raids. 

My question is... why? Most of the guilds on my server have insanely convoluted rolling systems that just seem so unnecessary when DKP exists. It’s kept me baffled, so perhaps someone has a better explanation than I’ve been able to think of myself.",0,whi do so mani wow guild use roll or loot council instead of dkp In everi other mmo ve play sinc everquest we have almost alway use dkp usual the system is someth like an open bid system with dkp abov certain amount decay to dissuad player from hoard too much thi ha alway seem like the fairest system becaus time invest is loot reward and if you want someth specif you can save for it you alway know where you stand and everyon get loot wow is the one game where guild almost seem to default to roll system mayb with certain restrict like one piec of loot per raid or other lockout but even with the most complic roll system it is far from fair someon alway get screw by rng and someon get way too lucki who doesn show up to raid My question is whi most of the guild on my server have insan convolut roll system that just seem so unnecessari when dkp exist It kept me baffl so perhap someon ha better explan than ve been abl to think of myself

I can still move the cursor for some reason and I can use my windows button, but, the client will not close no matter what I do so I have to do a hard reboot (sometimes I even have to unplug my computer it freezes so hard).

286,Ganking follows the same pattern as abuse," It's interesting how much you can learn about humans from playing video games.

We've all seen it happen, some dude gets to level 60 and then he goes ganking.

Keep in mind that currently there is no game mechanic benefit to doing this. He gains nothing from this other than the satisfaction that he is ruining other people's play. When challenged on, say, forums he'll tell you that ""it's allowed in the game, deal with it."" He absolutely does not care that he is just ruining other people's fun, in fact abusing powerless people makes him feel good.

But that's not the most interesting thing about this situation.

It gets really interesting when you see the reaction of those low level people. They are angry, frustrated, they feel powerless, and their response is not to level up and then hunt this guy down (it's a big server, you might not ever see that guy again). Instead, they say, ""Well I was hunted when I was a low level person, so to get justice I need to go hunt low level people.""

The people who were hurt decide to take out their hurt on people who were just like them: powerless. They are now the ones who want to feel powerful by hurting the powerless.

And this is a very human thing. This broken, perverse idea of justice is all  pervasive through humanity. It's not restricted by gender, social class, or race. You can always find people with this mentality. It drives many of humanities worst behaviors.

And it's so obviously wrong. If someone wrongs you, that does not give you license to wrong other, uninvolved third parties. No matter how bad what was done to you is, it is not OK for you to do the wrong thing that was done to you to someone else.

I've seen this perverse justice advocated for by every ideology (from fascists to far left feminists), every religion, every social class.

The only solution is for us to call it out when we see it, not just from our enemies, but from our allies. Especially from our allies. We must eradicate this behavior. We must create a culture where this kind of thing is not acceptable. No more excuses. No more rationalizations. No more misplaced sympathy.

Start today. Right now.

Here's my responses to the inevitable things people will post:  
1) ""But it's allowed in the game."" Abuse is allowed in real life by the physics engine that runs the universe, but it's still wrong.  
2) ""It's just a game"" (probably dozens of variants on this comment) Yes, it is, but that game is a social space for real humans, who are engaged in various kinds of social activity (including pvp), and thus there is a culture that arises from it. If you can't see that, you may need more schooling before we can have a real conversation.  
3) ""That's not abuse it's just for the lulz."" I'm sorry you were abused.  
4) ""I'm going to do it and you can't stop me."" Sure, only you can stop you mechanically, but you can face social isolation if the culture doesn't condone that kind of behavior. There will also be antisocial people, just remember that you chose your isolation.  
5) ""You think you're smart huh?"" (probably dozens of variants on this comment) I'm sorry that conversation that you have trouble following activates your shame, and I suggest you seek therapy to help you process your shame in more healthy ways.

289,Is Reckoning dead?," Hi guys.

Pretty casual player here, I'm a lvl 39 Dwarven Paladin.

I've been looking at a lot of builds for the Pala to try to maximize the hybrid potential of the class (I don't want to end up just being a healbot, at least not all the time). I like the idea of the ""warrior priest"" (of the Warhammer universe), getting in the heat with a big hammer and throwing heals, cleanses and blessings here and there along the way.

For that, I've been looking at the Holy Reckoning build (and other builds featuring the reckoning talent). However, most of these guides were made before launch of Classic, and it seems the Reckoning talent is working quite differently in Classic than on the Private servers where these builds were made and tested. In essence, on private servers you could stack reckoning hits with the /sit macro and save them for a ""reckoning bomb"". In Classic, Reckoning basically just resets youro swing timer (I don't care for using a /stopattack macro to utilize this, I just wanna play the game and keep swinging).

My question is: is Reckoning still a valid talent to build your toon for, as a melee healer that can take a hit, keep your party topped up and also deliver a hit once in a while?

Appreciate any thoughts - also regarding other builds with the same aim!

296,How essential is Consecration as a tank paladin? Question on talent path,"This is my first time playing wow classic, and I decided to roll with a paladin. I just hit level 20 and started looking at guides on paladin talent options. I want to be able to tank 5 man dungeons. I'm currently at Dead Mines, and I want to be able to tank it. I don't have consecration because I dumped all my talent points in protection. I already used my first respec because some dude made fun of me for putting it in ""worthless"" talents so I don't have the money to respec again. Im currently sitting with 10 points in protection and 1 unused point. Should I just continue down the protection tree and grab something like Improved righteous fury or start going down the holy tree?

297,"I'm confused, new player","~~How do you go from new to a player that connects the dots?
After watching classic guides as well as profession guides I'm left with confusion, because it seems like previous knowledge is required.
I don't understand what professions I should go with as mage, I've no idea what raids are.
It seems to me that professions are only worth for that one endgame item you might get, what about early game..? From my perspective this sounds incredibly boring because I have no idea what raids are.

I really enjoy making gold - pretty much what motivates me to play, it's very rewarding. So I try to learn new ways to make better gold etc, it's a fairly straight forward path. But when it comes to raids, dungeoning, finding recipes, choosing professions, choosing gear, it doesn't seem like there is a straight forward path for this, I don't understand. How do people gather this information, is it just from youtube videos?

299,Twinking is just bullying with extra steps. Change my mind.,"I recently had a discussion with some lvl 19 twink that kindda made me think a bit about this kind of stuff and want to open a serious discussion about it, please don't flame / troll, this is a serious discussion topic, so i hope to see some real arguments pro-twinking, if there are any serious ones that won't be dismissed by logic. Specially interested in the 19 bracket twinks.  

Now, before i start going at it, i totally understand why for some people it can be fun, it's just like smurfing, another disgusting ""meta"" that happens in gameplay modes with MMR like Counter Strike, DotA, etc...   

- **I have nothing against that, except the massive hypocrisy and the fact that twinks hide behind shitty arguments while they are straight up bullying and actively seeking weak targets to prey upon.**

Long story short, here is what i think about twinking, specially the lvl 19 bracket since that guy was really delusional:  

- i think it's straight up bullying of the weak. In open world 99.9% of your targets are white geared players with maximum 1-2 greens with shitty stats. You will have 4-5 times their hp and oneshot them without even breaking a sweat. A good geared twink has ~2200-2600 hp, more than my warlock when was in his late 40's., it's not different from lvl 60's raiding Elwynn Forest.

- twinks can't really be successful in pvp at lvl 60 where everyone is more or less equal, where there is build diversity and where the gear disparity isn't that high so they want an advantage in pvp, that's where the twinking came on. Why can't everyone be honest and call it ""lvl 19 bully bracket""? - *GIT GUD, SCRUB*

- there is no build diversity at lvl 19. I think all classes are more or less without options.  

- there is no fair pvp in this, 90% of 10-19 BG bracket will be again leveling players that will queue for fun. If you want fair pvp, is there any reason for not doing it at lvl 60? Build diversity, WAY MORE TARGETS, targets that fight back, geared targets that won't get oneshotted and will make the experience greater, is there literally any reason one would rather pvp at 19 if they want fair and enjoyable pvp?   

- no pve  

---------------------------------------------

To support my theory, i will quote the guy starting from beggining:   

- ""hope your server is in my battlegroup bud. so I can make your 19 WSG experience enjoyable."" (clearly bullying)  
- followed shortly by ""I would love to bully whiners like you, yeah."" - LOL  
------------------------------
- then by his only attempt at a comeback ""I am min maxing stats in a video game. to insult someone for that shows a pathetic lack of self-respect.""  

This one deserves a longer answer, but if you're min-maxing, green lvl 60 gear is better than your crappy min-maxing therefore your argument is invalid. If you want to farm, there is definately more diversity and hardship in getting lvl 60 gear, starting from 1% dungeon drops, 0.02% world drops and raid gear where sometimes you have to fight against 10-15 ppl who roll for the same item if you're a cloth user.  

At lvl 19, all you do is getting a high level boost you through dungeons and quests while you're still low level and can't pull your weight so you don't ding over 19. **Is this min-maxing when you're not doing anything by yourself? **  

-----------------------------
Back to retarded quotes:   

- Earlier today I followed a level ?? human paladin without a mount, so in his 30s, out of ratchet into the barrens. Where I proceeded to camp him as a level 19. I'd understand how butthurt you are if that were you.  

Again this needs a separate answer. At level 30's, a paladin is basically an auto-attack bot. You take pride in that, but levels aren't important at all in this discussion. He is still a white geared with few greens player. He is still weaker than you if you can camp him, again i will say that i had your hp in my late 40's. You're smurfing my friends, smurfing to bully weaker players. That's all there is to it. You camped his body, probably even masturbated after that. *Bullying at its finest*  

----------------------------
Back to retarded quotes  

- please please please tell me you play alliance on herod. I just want to bully you all day.   

Nuff said.   

--------------------------------------------------

**My conclusion:**  

- there is nothing in twinking except wanting to stomp white geared noobs. The fair pvp vs other twinks is so rare that at this point it's just an excuse for other 99% white geared leveling players you stomp in open world.  
- min-maxing? Nope, you're not min-maxing when someone else is doing all the job for you. When you get carried in dungeons / high lvl quests / Gurubashi arena / whatnot, the only think you will ever do is farm those fishing contests, but most twinks will never bother with that. That's not min-maxing, real min-maxing is at max level.  

- Being a smurf and going in open world pvp / BG in level appropriate zones isn't different from lvl 60's killing lvl 20's, it's just a disgusting habit.

- if you are twinking, at least be honest with yourself. Say it loud:  ""i'm a bully and i'm proud"".   

- before you comment and say i am wrong, get at my level. Get it? At my level... *brazilian laughing man.jpg*

317,Resto Druid Builds: Need Help Making Moonglow/Improved Regrowth work,"Hello;

I'm pretty bad at understanding underlying mechanics in games, and finding a resto spec that works for my playstyle has been very challenging.

After completing some MC/ONY, I've respec'd for a third time in hopes to try out a build that no one suggests: 2/3 Moonglow, 3/5 Improved Regrowth.

I love swiftmend but find in raiding environments that I barely use it as I'm typically trying to reduce my overhealing while raid healing/tank spot healing. I've really enjoyed leaving rejuvinations up on 6+ players and want to find a way to make regrowth spam viable in my rotation. Swiftmend has saved tanks and raid members on specific occasions but overall I do not use swiftmend more than \~10% of its up-time.

Would anyone be able to enlighten me on a build that maximizes the benefits of these talents and is not the standard shared on wowhead/icyveins?

This is currently what I am looking at, and will show how I fundamentally do not understand the mechanics behind healing:

2/3 moonglow 3/5 improved regrowth

I really enjoy increased crit on regrowth and the moonglow mana reduction. So, how would I optimize my healing and mana efficiency while still taking both of these talents? should moonglow be 3/3 and improved regrowth 2/5? should tranquil spirit or gift of nature always be 5/5? Should I just be plugging these into some best-build excel spreadsheet?

343,Druids need your help!,"Hello!


This post is a combination of requesting help, a PSA, and the only avenue I (and many other Horde druids) have left.


As most of you know, druid tanking and DPS late game as feral is already a niche role. Feral tanks are usually designated to OT, and feral DPS have to work extremely hard to put up numbers that even come to those of rogues, warlocks, or mages. Those of us who expect to play this role know that we have hurdles to jump over in order to be competitive and grinding out items is part of what we signed up for. One item in particular is very, very important for feral late game. The [Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9449/manual-crowd-pummeler).


Normally at level 60, farming out the Crowd Pummeler is time consuming but not exactly difficult. 5 runs of Gnomeregan when you log in, and 5 before you log out is consistently enough to make sure you are supplied for raid nights. The most difficult part of this process is simply getting to Gnomeregan! For alliance this is a simple walk over from Ironforge, but for Horde we rely on a nifty teleporter that is a short quest chain to finish. 


This is where the problem is. Currently as well as back in retail vanilla wow this quest has a major bug where if you pick up a completely unrelated quest in the Searing Gorge ([this one to be exact](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=7728/stolen-smithing-tuyere-and-lookouts-spyglass)), you will be unable to begin the [quest chain starting with Sovik in Orgrimmar](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=2842/chief-engineer-scooty) that allows you to use the teleporter. So if you are a level 60 Druid who is looking to begin their farming of the MCP, you might just be out of luck if you did questing in the Searing Gorge.

Previously back in vanilla, this problem was known but not exactly well documented. Resulting in quite a few people missing out on a solution. For those that did realize the problem, usually contacting a GM and requesting help was enough to have the quest added as well as being given the item needed to use the teleporter. Both [here](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=2842) and [here](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=2843) you will find in the comments individuals posting that they were able to reach out to a GM and have the problem fixed! And before the #nochanges crowd gets too mad, I am simply hoping for the same solutions that were offered back in 2007, the quest being manually added to our account as well as the necessary item. This bug might not be able to be fixed, but at least we should get the same support that was given way back when.

Currently there are many forum posts that show a mix of this bug being here to stay ([here](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/bad-customer-support-experience/309572), [here](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/unable-to-accept-quest-cheif-engineer-scooty/301926), and [here](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/quest-bug-cannot-teleport-to-gnomeregan/314497)) and other posts showing that the GMs can indeed fix the problem ([here](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/unable-to-flag-chief-engineer-scooty-gnomer-gooooone/320513/4), and [here](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/quest-chief-engineer-scooty/302951/31)).

I don't know if there are GMs who watch these forums, but we druids need a solution to this major problem. And there needs to be some consistency, either the problem can be fixed or it can't. The tickets have been submitted, and the forum posts have been made, but we have not been given an answer. Maybe I am wrong in taking the 2007scape approach to this problem by posting it on reddit, but it seems to me the only way that this problem will be fixed is if people make enough noise about it.

If you are a druid experiencing this problem, I highly recommend making a ticket to Blizzard in hopes that you will be one of the lucky few who are offered a solution ([Here is a link to file a ticket](https://us.battle.net/support/en/help/product/wow)). But even if you are not provided an answer, the more it is on their radar as a problem the more likely we are to be given an answer that solves this.

I'm not sure what the solution is to this problem or why an unrelated quest breaks the game so easily, but I am hopeful that with enough noise that maybe, just maybe, we can have a solution that will allow for us druids to play the game at our top level.

TL;DR: 
Blizzards buggy game that I love broke my kitty, and in 2007 we had better customer support than in 2019.",1571202584.0,"Druids need your help!Hello!

Both [here](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=2842) and [here](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=2843) you will find in the comments individuals posting that they were able to reach out to a GM and have the problem fixed! And before the #nochanges crowd gets too mad, I am simply hoping for the same solutions that were offered back in 2007, the quest being manually added to our account as well as the necessary item. This bug might not be able to be fixed, but at least we should get the same support that was given way back when.

Currently there are many forum posts that show a mix of this bug being here to stay ([here](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/bad-customer-support-experience/309572), [here](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/unable-to-accept-quest-cheif-engineer-scooty/301926), and [here](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/quest-bug-cannot-teleport-to-gnomeregan/314497)) and other posts showing that the GMs can indeed fix the problem ([here](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/unable-to-flag-chief-engineer-scooty-gnomer-gooooone/320513/4), and [here](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/quest-chief-engineer-scooty/302951/31)).

I don't know if there are GMs who watch these forums, but we druids need a solution to this major problem. And there needs to be some consistency, either the problem can be fixed or it can't. The tickets have been submitted, and the forum posts have been made, but we have not been given an answer. Maybe I am wrong in taking the 2007scape approach to this problem by posting it on reddit, but it seems to me the only way that this problem will be fixed is if people make enough noise about it.

If you are a druid experiencing this problem, I highly recommend making a ticket to Blizzard in hopes that you will be one of the lucky few who are offered a solution ([Here is a link to file a ticket](https://us.battle.net/support/en/help/product/wow)). But even if you are not provided an answer, the more it is on their radar as a problem the more likely we are to be given an answer that solves this.

I'm not sure what the solution is to this problem or why an unrelated quest breaks the game so easily, but I am hopeful that with enough noise that maybe, just maybe, we can have a solution that will allow for us druids to play the game at our top level.
